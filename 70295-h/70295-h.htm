<span class="fs70">UNCLE WIGGILY AND MOTHER GOOSE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Uncle Wiggily Longears, the old gentleman
rabbit, sat in his burrow-house reading the
morning paper. It was after breakfast, on a nice,
sunny May day, and outside the flowers were
blossoming and making perfume and honey for
the bees as they nodded their heads in the air. I
mean the flowers nodded their heads—not the
bees. The bees were far too busy to do that.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Uncle Wiggily to himself, “I
think I must get one. They are getting very
fashionable and stylish. I certainly must get one
for myself,” and he let the paper slip down to the
floor, and he sat there in his easy chair, sort of
thinking to himself, and nodding his head every
now and then, as he said, over and over again:</p>

<p>“Yes, I must get one. It will do me more
good than riding around in my automobile or
going to the seashore.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>“My gracious me sakes alive and some horseradish
apple pie!” exclaimed Nurse Jane Fuzzy
Wuzzy, the muskrat lady who kept house for
Uncle Wiggily. She was out in the kitchen, doing
up the dishes, and she heard what the old rabbit
gentleman had said, though he did not think
she had.</p>

<p>“I wonder what it is he is going to do now?”
Nurse Jane said to herself. “He’s been so
funny lately—doing those queer new dances—the
corn meal flop, the apple dumpling dip and
the machoo-choo slide. I hope he isn’t going to
do anything more foolish. I wonder what it is?”</p>

<p>But Uncle Wiggily didn’t tell Nurse Jane—at
least just then. He got up, put on his fur coat—oh,
listen to me, would you! A fur coat
in May! I mean Uncle Wiggily put on his light
coat, and without wearing a hat, which he never
did in the summer, out he went, leaving Nurse
Jane to wonder what it was he was going to do.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily went to a store where they sold
toy circus balloons, and of the monkey gentleman
who kept the store he asked:</p>

<p>“Have you any flying machines?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean—flying machines?”
asked the monkey gentleman. “Do you mean
birds?”</p>

<p>“Well, birds are flying machines, of course,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
the rabbit gentleman said. “But I mean a sort
of airship that I could go up in as if I were in a
balloon, and fly around in the clouds. I am going
to get one of those airships for a change.”</p>

<p>“Ha!” exclaimed the monkey gentleman.
“You certainly are a queer one, Uncle Wiggily,
to want to do that. But I am sorry to say I have
no airships.”</p>

<p>“Then I will have to make one,” said the rabbit.
“Please give me some of your balloons.”</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily took some red balloons, two
blue ones, a green one, a pink one and one colored
skilligimink, which is a very funny color. It was
like the Easter egg dye color into which Sammie
Littletail, the rabbit boy, once fell, getting all
splashed up.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you are going to make an airship
out of those toy balloons,” said the monkey
gentleman.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you,” spoke Uncle Wiggily. “I
next need a clothes basket. I’ll leave my balloons
here until I get that. You see,” the old
rabbit gentleman went on, “I want to surprise
my housekeeper, Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy.
She doesn’t know I’m going to have an airship,”
and Uncle Wiggily winked both eyes, sort of
comical like, and twinkled his nose as if he were
going to sneeze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>He went off to get the clothes basket, and when
he had it he fastened the toy balloons to it by
strings tied to the handles.</p>

<p>“There!” exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. “You
see, the toy balloons will lift up the clothes basket
and me in it. That will be an airship.”</p>

<p>“But will it sail in the air?” asked the monkey
gentleman.</p>

<p>“To be sure it will,” Uncle Wiggily said.
“To make it go forward I am going to put an
electric fan in the back of the clothes basket.
The fan will whizz around and push the air
away, and when the air is pushed out of the way
I can shoot ahead, and I’ll be sailing. Now you
watch me, if you please.”</p>

<p>So the rabbit gentleman tied the balloons to
the clothes basket, and he made the basket fast
to the ground with some clothes-pins, so it
wouldn’t go up before he was ready for it. Next
he got an electric fan, which goes around whizzie-izzie
and makes the air cool on a hot day, and the
rabbit gentleman fastened this fan on the back of
his clothes basket.</p>

<p>“Now I have my airship,” Uncle Wiggily said
to the monkey gentleman. “I shall go up and
sail to my burrow. I think Nurse Jane will be
surprised.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily started to climb into the
basket.</p>

<p>“Wait! Wait!” called the monkey gentleman,
who had sold him the toy balloons.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” asked Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>“You had better take some soft sofa cushions
in with you,” spoke the monkey gentleman.
“You—you might fall in your airship, you
know,” he whispered, sort of bashful like, “and
the cushions would be a good thing to fall on.”</p>

<p>“I believe you are right,” Uncle Wiggily answered.
“Thank you! I’ll take a few.”</p>

<p>So he put some sofa cushions in the clothes
basket.</p>

<p>“Now I am ready!” he called. “Please take
off the clothes-pins and I will go up. I am going
to sail like the airship-birdmen I read of in the
newspaper this morning.”</p>

<p>The monkey gentleman took the clothes-pins
off the ropes that held down Uncle Wiggily’s
airship and pop-up it went, lifted by the toy balloons—red,
green, blue, orange and skilligimink
color.</p>

<p>“Now, here I go!” cried the rabbit gentleman,
as he started the electric fan. And, surely
enough, through the air he sailed, as nicely as you
please, right above the tree tops, in his new airship
he flew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, this is great!” cried Uncle Wiggily.
Pretty soon he was right over his house. “I’m
always going to travel this way, from now on,” he
said. “Airships are fine.”</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, something happened.
Mother Goose, who happened to be flying
through the air on a broomstick, that day, accidentally
dropped a paper of pins she had just
bought. They fell down with their sharp points
on Uncle Wiggily’s balloons, that were fastened
to the clothes-basket. The balloons burst, “Pop!
Pop! Poppity! Pop! Pop!” and down fell
the clothes-basket airship, Uncle Wiggily and all.</p>

<p>“Oh dear!” cried Mother Goose.</p>

<p>Right down in front of his own door Uncle
Wiggily fell and only for the soft cushions he
might have been hurt. As it was, his rheumatism
was jarred up a little.</p>

<p>“Oh, my!” cried Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy,
rushing out of the house. “What is this? What
has happened, Wiggy?”</p>

<p>“Why, this is my new airship,” answered the
rabbit gentleman, sort of dazed and puzzled like.
“I just made it and I came along to surprise
you.”</p>

<p>“Well, you surprised me all right,” said
Nurse Jane. “Now, come in the house and I’ll
rub your back with witch hazel. You must be all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
bruised! You had better leave airships alone
after this.”</p>

<p>“I guess I had,” said Uncle Wiggily sadly.</p>

<p>But do you s’pose he did? Not a bit of it. He
was right at it again next day, and in the story
after this, if the rose bush doesn’t scratch the eyes
out of the potato salad, I’ll tell you about Uncle
Wiggily up a tree.</p>

<span class="fs70">UNCLE WIGGILY UP A TREE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Uncle Wiggily Longears, the old gentleman
rabbit, walked out in front of his burrow house
one morning, and looked at his new airship. He
limped a little, for you know he had had a fall the
day before, tumbling down almost out of the
clouds. But he fell on some sofa cushions, that
the monkey gentleman had put in the clothes
basket part of the airship, so Mr. Longears was
not much hurt—only his rheumatism was sort of
twisted.</p>

<p>I guess I told you, did I not, how Uncle
Wiggily made himself an airship out of some
toy balloons, a clothes basket, and an electric fan?
He thought he would fly through the air for a
while, instead of riding around in his automobile.</p>

<p>But Mother Goose had accidentally dropped a
lot of pins on the toy balloons that lifted up the
airship, and when the balloons burst, with loud
“pops,” the airship came down “ker-floppo!”—if
you will kindly excuse me for saying so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>So Uncle Wiggily walked out in front of his
burrow, or underground house, and looked at his
broken airship.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it will never sail again!” said
Uncle Wiggily, sadly, as he noticed the burst balloons
and the clothes basket, which had quite a
dent in one of the handles. The electric fan was
not hurt at all, I am glad to say, only it had
stopped whizzing around, of course.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad!” Uncle Wiggily went on.
“My nice airship, that I thought would take me
sailing all over, is broken. I can’t go riding in it
again.”</p>

<p>“What!” cried Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy,
the muskrat lady, who kept house for the rabbit
gentleman. “You don’t mean to tell me that
you would ever go sailing again in an airship,
after what happened; would you?”</p>

<p>“I certainly would,” answered Uncle Wiggily,
as he combed out his whiskers with a shoestring.
“I would love to go airshipping again.”</p>

<p>“Well, well!” cried Nurse Jane. “This is
worse than dancing the clam chowder clip! I am
certainly surprised at you.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t need to worry,” said Uncle
Wiggily. “My airship is broken, so there is not
much danger of me going sailing again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>“I am glad of it,” said Nurse Jane, “for your
sake.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ho!” exclaimed a voice from behind the
ice cream freezer, “something broken, eh? Well,
perhaps I can fix it,” and out stepped Dr. Possum,
with his satchel of red, white and blue pills.
“What is broken?” he asked. “Anybody’s legs
or arms?”</p>

<p>“My airship,” replied Uncle Wiggily. “The
balloons that lift it up into the air are all burst
from Mother Goose’s pins.”</p>

<p>“Ha! Buy new balloons!” cried Dr. Possum.
“That’s easy!”</p>

<p>“The very thing!” exclaimed Uncle Wiggily.
“I never thought of that. But the clothes basket
has a dent in it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, as to that, I can easily fix the dent,” said
Dr. Possum. “I am used to fixing dents. I
can do harder things than that. You go get some
more new toy balloons, and I’ll fix the basket.
You shall have your airship again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me and some molasses pancakes!”
cried Nurse Jane. “I can see a lot more trouble
ahead for Uncle Wiggily if he is going around in
an airship. I had better buy some court-plaster
at the five and six cent store, for he will need it.
He is sure to fall again, and get all cut and
bruised.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>So Nurse Jane kindly went to the store for
the court-plaster. Dr. Possum mended the dent
in the clothes basket, and Uncle Wiggily went
after the toy balloons. He got some red, green,
yellow and sky-blue-pink ones, and soon his airship
was made over as good as ever again.</p>

<p>“Now watch me sail in it!” the rabbit gentleman
cried, as he got into the clothes basket, to
which the balloons and electric fan were fastened.
“I’m going away up to the clouds this time.”</p>

<p>“Well, I only hope you don’t fall,” said Nurse
Jane, sort of anxious like.</p>

<p>“I’ve got the soft sofa cushions under me, if
I do,” answered Uncle Wiggily, with a laugh.</p>

<p>Up he went, high in the air, the electric fan going
whizzie-izzie, and the balloons lifting the
clothes basket off the ground.</p>

<p>Well, Uncle Wiggily in his airship, sailed on
and on, and pretty soon, all of a sudden, quick-like,
it began to hail. There was a hard hail
storm. And hail, you know, is frozen rain.
Down pelted the round hail stones on Uncle
Wiggily and his airship.</p>

<p>“Oh, me! Oh, my, and some lolly-pops!”
cried Uncle Wiggily. “I think something is going
to happen.” And just then a hail stone hit
on the end of his twinkling nose, making him
sneeze—“ker-cher! Ker-choo!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>Then something else happened. More hail
stones came down, and “Pop! Pop! Pop!”
went the toy balloons, bursting one after another,
as the hard hail hit them, just as when the Mother
Goose pins had pricked them.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! I’m going to fall again!” cried
the rabbit gentleman, for he knew when the balloons
burst there would be nothing to hold him
and his clothesbasket airship up above the earth.</p>

<p>And, surely enough, he began to fall. Down
and down he went, with the hail falling all around
him.</p>

<p>“My! I hope the sofa cushions don’t fall out
of my clothes basket!” thought the rabbit gentleman,
“for if they do I will get a very hard
bump.”</p>

<p>But, as it happened, he did not need the soft
cushions, for, all of a sudden, his airship turned
over, and he fell into a tree, spilling right out,
and landing in the branches. Luckily, there were
green leaves on them, and they made a soft place
on which Uncle Wiggily fell. He was scratched
some, but Nurse Jane’s court plaster would fix
that. The airship, however, kept on falling until
it landed on the ground at the foot of the tree.</p>

<p>“Oh, I wonder how I am to get down?” said
Uncle Wiggily. “It is very far from the top of
this tree to the earth, and I cannot climb, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
Bushytail squirrel boys, or as Kittie Kat can.
What shall I do? Oh, dear!”</p>

<p>And just then along came Johnnie Bushytail,
the squirrel boy, himself.</p>

<p>“I’ll help you get down!” called Johnnie to
Uncle Wiggily. “I’ll get a rope, and climb up
with it to you. Then you can make a rope ladder,
fasten one end to a limb of the tree, and climb
down that.”</p>

<p>“Fine!” cried Uncle Wiggily. The little
squirrel boy found a grape vine rope, and up the
tree he scrambled, carrying one end of it up to
Uncle Wiggily, who soon made a rope ladder,
such as sailors use. Then the rabbit gentleman
came down on that as nicely as you please.</p>

<p>“Well, my airship is badly broken,” he said,
as he looked at the burst balloons and the bent
and twisted clothes basket. “I shall have to fix
it before I can sail again.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me you are going up in
that dangerous thing again?” asked Nurse Jane
Fuzzy Wuzzy, as she stuck a piece of red, white
and blue court plaster on Uncle Wiggily’s nose,
where the hail stone had hit him.</p>

<p>“I am going to try,” he said, modest like, and
shy.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me, and some popcorn cakes!” cried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
Nurse Jane. “I never saw such a rabbit—never!”</p>

<p>Then Uncle Wiggily got old dog Percival,
with the express wagon, to cart home the broken
airship. And in the story after this, if the ice
cream cone doesn’t jump up and down on the
tablecloth, and poke holes in the loaf of bread,
I’ll tell you about Uncle Wiggily and the little
birds.</p>

<span class="fs70">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE LITTLE BIRDS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Uncle Wiggily Longears, the old rabbit
gentleman, was out in his yard one day, whistling
away, hammering and sawing and making his
funny nose twinkle like a star on a frosty night in
June. He could not twinkle his nose so very well
because it had on it a piece of red, white and
blue court plaster. And the reason he had the
plaster there was because the last time he was
out in his airship, he had had an accident, and a
hailstone had struck him on the nose, as I have
told you.</p>

<p>You just try to make your nose twinkle with a
piece of court plaster on it, and see how hard it is.
It’s almost as hard as it is to stand on your head
and peel a basket of soap bubbles.</p>

<p>But still Uncle Wiggily was doing the best he
could, and, as I have said, he was whistling and
hammering and sawing.</p>

<p>“What in the world are you doing?” asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady,
who kept house for Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>“I am fixing my airship,” he said. You know
he had one, made of a clothes basket, with an
electric fan to send it along through the air
whizzy-izzie-like, and to lift the airship Uncle
Wiggily used a lot of toy circus balloons, tied together.</p>

<p>“Going up in your airship!” cried Nurse
Jane. “Why, you were out in it the other day,
and look what a terrible fall you had. The hailstones
burst your balloons and down you came in
a tree. And Johnnie Bushytail, the squirrel, had
to get you a wild grape vine rope so you could
climb down.”</p>

<p>“I know he did,” said Uncle Wiggily, cheerful-like.
“And I am very thankful to him.”</p>

<p>“And still, and with all that happened to you,
getting your nose scratched and all that, are you
again going up in your airship?” Nurse Jane
wanted to know.</p>

<p>“I am going up,” said Uncle Wiggily bravely.
“I want to learn how to sail all over the world in
my airship.”</p>

<p>“But suppose another hailstorm comes and
smashes your balloons?” asked Nurse Jane
Fuzzy Wuzzy. “You will fall again, and you
may be hurt worse next time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>“No more hailstones can bother me!” cried
the rabbit gentleman. “See, I am going to
fasten an umbrella over my toy balloons, and
then no hailstones can hit them.” And he
whistled more cheerfully than before.</p>

<p>“Well, I do declare!” exclaimed Nurse Jane.
“You are surely odd!”</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily really was fastening a Japanese
umbrella over his funny clothes basket airship.</p>

<p>“The umbrella will keep off the sun as well as
the rain and hail,” he said happy-like.</p>

<p>Well, the old gentleman rabbit was just getting
ready to go up in his airship again, when,
from among the leaves of a tree that grew in his
garden, he heard a voice saying:</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Now, birdies, it is time you learned to fly.
Stand on the limb, where our nest is built, flutter
your wings as I do, and jump off. Keep your
wings fluttering and you will be flying.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but we are afraid!” cried several tiny
chirping voices.</p>

<p>“Ha! That is a mother bird teaching her
little ones to fly,” said Uncle Wiggily, as he
looked up. “I must watch this. I love little
birds.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid,” said the mamma bird to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
children birds. “You will not fall. When I was
a little bird I was afraid, too, but nothing happened
to me and I have been flying ever since.
Come now, jump off the tree branch into the
air.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re afraid!” cried the littlest of the
birdies.</p>

<p>“Our wings might come off, and then we’d
drop to the ground,” said another little bird, as it
fluttered back into the nest.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” cried the mamma bird. “Your
wings will not drop off and you will not fall.
You must learn to fly now. You are getting old
enough to fly for yourselves. Come, Pickie!”
she called to the one who had gone back in the
nest, “stand in line with the others and learn to
fly.”</p>

<p>“Oh, mamma! I can’t! Really I can’t!”
cried Pickie, who was given that name because
he had such a sharp little bill for picking up bread
crumbs.</p>

<p>“You must learn to fly,” said the mamma bird.
“Your papa will soon be home, and think how
proud he will be if you can fly to meet him!”</p>

<p>“Oh, we are afraid,” said the little birds.</p>

<p>It is just like when baby first learns to walk.
At the beginning he is afraid to take a step alone,
but soon he grows braver and toddles all over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>“Come! Fly!” called the mamma bird.</p>

<p>“We are afraid—afraid!” chirped the little
birdies.</p>

<p>“Ha! I think I can help the mamma bird
give them their flying lesson,” said Uncle Wiggily.
“I will go up in my airship and float slowly
along. I will keep right under the little birds,
and I’ll tell them that if their wings give out, and
if they fall, they will land on my umbrella and
not get hurt at all.”</p>

<p>So away he went in his airship, and when he
got near the top of the tree, with the electric fan
buzzing and the toy balloons lifting him up, the
rabbit gentleman called:</p>

<p>“See me, birdies! I am flying, and you know
a rabbit has no wings. Look!”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said the mamma bird. “See, little
ones! If Uncle Wiggily is not afraid to fly, you
should not be, for you were made on purpose for
sailing through the air, and he was not.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll keep right under you with my airship,
to catch you if you fall,” said Uncle Wiggily.
“Don’t be afraid, birdies!”</p>

<p>“All right! Here we come!” cried Pickie,
getting brave all of a sudden. Off the limb he
fluttered, and his brothers and sisters fluttered
after him, flapping their wings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, we are flying!” they cried joyfully.
“We can fly!”</p>

<p>“I knew you could,” called their mamma, soaring
on her wings after them. “And how proud
your papa will be! Thank you so much, Uncle
Wiggily, for making my birdies brave enough to
fly.”</p>

<p>“Pray do not mention it,” answered the rabbit
gentleman politely, as he sailed about in his
airship.</p>

<p>He kept under the little birds for a while, in
case they might fall, but none of them did, and
soon they fluttered back to the nest for supper.
They had learned to fly and were not afraid any
more. Wasn’t that good?</p>

<p>And in the next story, if the dish doesn’t run
away with the spoon and go to the moving picture
show in our back yard, I’ll tell you about
Uncle Wiggily and Grandfather Goosey Gander.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="STORY_IV">STORY IV<br>
<span class="fs70">UNCLE WIGGILY AND GRANDPA GOOSEY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Well, where are you going to-day?” asked
Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady, of
Uncle Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman,
as she saw him putting on his red necktie and
starting out toward the barn where he kept his
airship.</p>

<p>“Where am I going?” he repeated. “Well,
to tell you the truth, Nurse Jane, I hardly
know.”</p>

<p>“Out in your airship, I suppose,” she said, as
she looked in the bread box to see if there was any
rice pudding for the pussy cat to play store with.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I am going to fly about a bit,” said
the rabbit gentleman. “Perhaps I may have an
adventure; who knows?”</p>

<p>“Well, I know one thing you will have if you
go flying around in that airship of yours,” said
Nurse Jane, putting on her apron to peel the
oranges for the clam chowder. “You’ll have a
fall; that’s what you’ll have. And you’ll skin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
your nose and stub your toes and maybe rub off
the fur from your ears for all I know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I trust not! I trust not!” exclaimed
Uncle Wiggily quickly, holding up his paws. “I
hope nothing like that will happen. The last
time I rode in my airship I did not fall—when I
helped to teach the little birds to fly.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sure you’ll fall this time,” spoke
Nurse Jane.</p>

<p>“You are not very cheerful this morning,”
laughed Uncle Wiggily. “Have no fear; I will
come back safe and sound.”</p>

<p>“Well, all the same, you had better take some
court-plaster along in case you scratch your
twinkling nose on a bramble briar bush,” said the
muskrat lady. So Uncle Wiggily took the court-plaster
with him.</p>

<p>Then he went for a ride in his queer airship.
I call it queer because it was very odd. The old
rabbit gentleman’s airship was made of a clothes
basket, with a lot of toy circus balloons tied to it
to make it rise up. In back there was a whizzy
electric fan to make the airship go along like an
automobile, and there was a baby carriage wheel
to steer it by. On top of all this was a big Japanese
umbrella fastened over the balloons, to keep
hail stones from pelting holes in them and making
them burst.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>That happened once, and Uncle Wiggily and
his airship had a dreadful fall, just like Humpty-Dumpty.</p>

<p>“But I’ll not fall to-day,” said Uncle Wiggily,
as he got in the clothes basket and sat on the sofa
cushions.</p>

<p>He had taken the airship outside the barn, and
as he loosed the string that held it fast, up it shot
into the air, just like a balloon. Then Uncle
Wiggily started the electric fan, and away he
went as nicely as you please.</p>

<p>“Oh, there he goes!” cried Sammie and Susie
Littletail, the rabbit children, as they stood on
the ground below, and watched him. “Please
take us for a ride, Uncle Wiggily!” they begged.</p>

<p>“Not now, my dears,” he said kindly. “Some
other time I will. You must go to school now.”</p>

<p>So Sammie and Susie hopped on to school, and
Uncle Wiggily traveled along in his airship.</p>

<p>“I wonder what sort of an adventure I will
have?” he said. “Ha! I have it! I will go call
on Grandfather Goosey Gander. I will take
him for a ride.”</p>

<p>He went to the old goose gentleman’s pen, but
when he got there, and invited Grandpa Goosey
to get into the clothes basket, Grandpa Goosey
said:</p>

<p>“What! Trust myself in an airship, high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
above the ground? No, indeed, thank you, Uncle
Wiggily. I have no use for airships. They are
too dangerous! They are no good!”</p>

<p>“I am sorry you think so, and will not come
with me,” said Uncle Wiggily, sort of sadly like.
“I think airships are fine. I am going off looking
for an adventure.”</p>

<p>“And I am going to the woods to gather
acorns for my kitchen fire,” said the goose
gentleman. “But I am going to walk. It is
safer, by far. Airships are not good for animals
like us.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think they are,” spoke Uncle Wiggily,
as he rose in the air again.</p>

<p>The rabbit gentleman circled around, flying
along in his clothes basket airship, and he was
having a fine ride. But no adventure happened
to him. By and by, after a while, not so very
long, Uncle Wiggily found himself flying over a
big woods.</p>

<p>“I wonder if this is the forest where Grandfather
Goosey went to gather acorns?” thought
Uncle Wiggily. “If it is, maybe he will be so
tired, if he is here, that he will be glad to ride
home in my airship.”</p>

<p>Pretty soon the old rabbit gentleman heard a

<p>He looked down, and what do you think he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>saw? Why, the old goose gentleman was caught
fast in a trap by both legs. Some hunter had set
a trap to catch a fox, and poor Grandfather
Goosey Gander had stepped into it by mistake.
There he was, held fast.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” cried Grandpa Goosey. “What
shall I do? I have tried to get out and I can’t.
I have called for help, but no one comes to me. I
am away off in the woods alone, and here I must
die in the trap. Oh, I wish I had even gone in
Uncle Wiggily’s airship! Oh, will no one help
me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will help you!” cried the rabbit gentleman.
“Here I am, Grandpa Goosey!” And
wasn’t the goose gentleman surprised, when he
looked up and saw his rabbit friend in the airship
over his head? Oh, he certainly was surprised.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily made his airship go down, and
then he soon helped Grandpa Goosey out of the
fox trap. He put some court-plaster on the
goose gentleman’s scratched legs and asked:</p>

<p>“Now will you ride home in my airship?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I will,” said Grandpa Goosey.
“Airships are good after all. I am sorry I said
they were not.”</p>

<p>“Pray do not mention such a thing. I knew
you didn’t mean it,” Uncle Wiggily said. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
he and Grandpa Goosey rode safely home
through the air, and, if the blackbird on our fence
doesn’t pick all the clothes pins off the chocolate
cake, I’ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and
the fire.</p>

<span class="fs70">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE FIRE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“What do you think, mamma!” cried Sammie
Littletail, the rabbit boy, as he came running
in the house after school one fine day. “Oh,
what do you think?”</p>

<p>“Why, I’m sure I don’t know, Sammie, my
dear,” said Mrs. Littletail, smiling at him. “I
think of a great many things, of course.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he means what do you think teacher told
us!” cried Sammie’s sister Susie, as she came in
more slowly, for girl rabbits cannot run quite as
fast as can rabbit boys.</p>

<p>“Did your teacher say you were good little
animal children to-day, and that you had your
lessons well?” Mrs. Littletail wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Well, she did say that,” spoke Sammie, sort
of bashful like and shy, “but I think you can’t
guess what I mean. She said we ought to make
a little garden, each for ourselves, and grow
things to eat in it. The one who has the best
garden will get a prize.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>“And I’m going to have a garden and raise
lettuce!” cried Susie.</p>

<p>“And I’m going to have one and plant carrots.
And I’m going to give Uncle Wiggily some!”
added Sammie.</p>

<p>“It will be very nice for each of you to make
a garden,” said the rabbit children’s mamma.
“You may each have a little part of our big
garden for yourselves.”</p>

<p>“And we are to do all the work, too,” explained
Sammie. “We must clear off the
ground, spade it up, rake it smooth, put in the
seeds and water them when they come up.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course, if it’s your garden, you must
look after it yourselves,” said Mrs. Littletail.</p>

<p>So Sammie and Susie began to make their
garden. First they raked away the brush, sticks
and leaves from the ground that was to be dug
up. This brush they piled in a big heap in the
large garden.</p>

<p>“That pile of brush does not look very nice
there,” said their mamma.</p>

<p>“Oh, we are going to burn it when we get
through,” said Sammie. “Teacher said we were
to burn up all trash and rubbish, for the ashes
were good to mix with the garden dirt. I don’t
know why, but ashes make the ground better.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Mrs. Littletail, “but you had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
better let your papa burn the brush. He will
have more brush when he rakes up the ground
for his garden. Animal or real children should
not play with fire,” said the mamma rabbit.</p>

<p>So Sammie and Susie Littletail went on making
their garden, and in it they planted cabbage,
radishes, lettuce and carrots—all things that
rabbits love to eat. A few days later their papa,
Mr. Littletail, the rabbit gentleman, made his
garden, and he raked up a big pile of brush.
When the garden was all nice and smooth Mr.
Littletail said:</p>

<p>“Now I will burn that brush.”</p>

<p>“And may we watch you?” asked Sammie.</p>

<p>“Yes, if you do not come too close,” his papa
said.</p>

<p>Mr. Littletail set fire to the big pile of dried
brush, sticks and leaves, and my goodness me
sakes alive and some peanut pancakes! How it
did blaze up! It crackled like the Fourth of
July, and the heat was so great that Mr. Littletail
had to jump back very quickly.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a fine fire!” cried Susie.</p>

<p>“We could roast potatoes in it if it were not
so large,” spoke Sammie. “But it is too hot
now.”</p>

<p>“Indeed it is,” his father said. “Keep back.”</p>

<p>Hotter and hotter grew the brush fire. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
blaze leaped up, and then every one had to run
far away. The fire grew so hot that the Littletail
house began to smoke and scorch.</p>

<p>“Oh, our house will catch fire from the
brush!” cried Sammie.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am afraid it will!” exclaimed Mr.
Littletail. “I must get some pails of water and
throw on the brush fire.”</p>

<p>But, by this time, the fire was so hot that,
when Mr. Littletail had the water, he could not
get near enough to toss it on the blaze.</p>

<p>“Oh, what shall we do!” cried his wife. “Our
house will burn down! Oh, I must save what I
can!”</p>

<p>So she threw the clock and a lot of her best
dishes out of the window, and they were broken,
I am sorry to say. Then Mrs. Littletail carefully
carried out the feather bed. You see she was so
excited that she did things backwards. She
should have thrown the feather bed out of the
window, for that would not break. And she
ought to have carried the clock and dishes down
stairs in her apron.</p>

<p>Hotter and hotter grew the fire, and the rabbit
house was beginning to smoke and blaze.</p>

<p>“Call out the water bug fire department!”
shouted Grandfather Goosey Gander. But the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
water bugs had gone away on an excursion, and
could not come.</p>

<p>“Oh, my lovely house will burn!” cried Mrs.
Littletail.</p>

<p>“No, I know how to save it!” shouted Sammie.
“I’ll go get Uncle Wiggily Longears in
his airship. We can go up in the air over the fire
and spill a pail of water on it. He won’t be
burned as he will be so high up, but the water will
put out the fire.”</p>

<p>“Go and get him quickly then!” shouted Mr.
Littletail hopping up and down on his big ears.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily came sailing along in his airship
right away when Sammie called him. The
rabbit gentleman took up with him many pails
of water, and when he had steered his airship
high up over the fire, where he was out of danger,
Uncle Wiggily spilled down the water, just like
rain from the clouds, and the fire hissed like a
snake, and went out.</p>

<p>The brush was all burned up, of course, and
the Littletail house was scorched on the roof, but
not very much. Uncle Wiggily had put it out
just in time.</p>

<p>“But if it hadn’t been for your airship I don’t
know what we would have done!” cried Mr.
Littletail. “Thank you so much!”</p>

<p>“Pray do not mention it,” said Uncle Wiggily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
politely, as he wagged his tail up and down as
well as sideways.</p>

<p>Then the rabbit gentleman helped pick up the
broken dishes, and he mended the broken clock
and all was well. And Mr. Littletail did not
make such a big brush fire again.</p>

<p>And on the next page, if the carpenter man
doesn’t take our bathtub away to slide his little
puppy dog down hill in, I’ll tell you about Uncle
Wiggily and Dr. Possum.</p>

<span class="fs70">UNCLE WIGGILY HELPS DR. POSSUM</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Off again, I see!” Nurse Jane Fuzzy
Wuzzy, the muskrat lady, exclaimed one morning
to Uncle Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman,
for whom she kept house. “Off again,
Wiggy!”</p>

<p>You see she called him Wiggy as a sort of pet
name.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am off again,” spoke Uncle Wiggily,
as he put some extra soft cushions in his clothes
basket airship. “I am going on a long trip this
time.”</p>

<p>“Pray, where are you going?” asked the
muskrat lady. “That is, if you do not mind me
asking,” she said quickly.</p>

<p>“Oh, not at all. I don’t mind telling you,”
Uncle Wiggily answered. “I am going to see
if I can find an adventure.”</p>

<p>“Oh, such a queer old rabbit gentleman as you
are, Wiggy,” said Nurse Jane with a laugh.
“Instead of sitting quietly at home here, making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
a garden, or reading, you go chasing off across
the country in that funny airship of yours.
Something is sure to happen to you!”</p>

<p>“Well, the things that happen are adventures,”
said Uncle Wiggily. “And I like the
nice ones. Of course I do not like to fall out of
my airship, as I sometimes do, but that cannot
be helped. I always have a little red white and
blue court-plaster with me to put on any
scratches I may get.</p>

<p>“And now, Nurse Jane, I’ll say good-by. I
am going to look for an adventure.”</p>

<p>Into his airship, made of a clothes basket, some
toy balloons, a Japanese umbrella and an electric
fan, Uncle Wiggily placed himself. Then he
sailed up in the air, farther and farther, until he
was higher than the birds.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, as he was riding along, thinking
what fun it was to have an airship, the rabbit
gentleman heard some one down on the ground
below crying:</p>

<p>“Oh dear! Oh, who will help me?”</p>

<p>“Ha! I wonder who that is,” said Uncle
Wiggily. So he looked over the edge of the
clothes basket and he saw Mrs. Wibblewobble,
the duck lady, running up and down in front of
her pen-house, flapping her wings, all excited-like.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>“Ha! Trouble!” cried Uncle Wiggily. “I’ll
go down and see what it is.” Down he went in
his airship.</p>

<p>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily!” cried Mrs. Wibblewobble.
“My boy, Jimmie, is very ill, and I
have no one to send for Dr. Possum. Will you
go?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I will!” the rabbit gentleman said.
“I’ll make him come right back with me and
cure Jimmie.”</p>

<p>Off Uncle Wiggily sailed again in his airship,
but when he got to Dr. Possum’s office the old
gentleman animal physician made the same fuss
about an airship as Grandfather Goosey Gander,
the goose gentleman, did at first.</p>

<p>“If you’ll get in with me I’ll ride you straight
to the Wibblewobble duck house, and you can
cure Jimmie,” said the rabbit gentleman.</p>

<p>“What! Trust myself in a clothes basket
away up in the air? Never; thank you just the
same!” cried Dr. Possum. “I’ll come along, as
I always do, on my own legs.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you won’t come with me, I suppose
you won’t,” Uncle Wiggily said. “But I’ll ride
on ahead and tell them you are on the way.”</p>

<p>“All right, only I am sure I will get there before
you,” spoke Dr. Possum. “I do not think
much of airships.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>“Neither did Grandpa Goosey Gander, at
first,” said the rabbit gentleman with a laugh.</p>

<p>Off started Dr. Possum through the woods,
carrying his bag of medicine on his tail. Overhead
Uncle Wiggily started in his airship. And
of course Uncle Wiggily reached the Wibblewobble
house first, for airships can go very fast,
you know.</p>

<p>“Where is Dr. Possum?” asked Mrs. Wibblewobble,
who was waiting outside. “My little
duck boy is very ill.”</p>

<p>“The doctor is coming,” said Uncle Wiggily.
“He would not ride with me; he walked.” Well,
they waited and they waited, but no Dr. Possum
came. Meanwhile Jimmie was getting worse.
He had cocoanut-cake-fever, which is very bad.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll sail back in my airship and see
what keeps Dr. Possum,” Uncle Wiggily said.
“Perhaps something has happened to him.”</p>

<p>And there had! Just think of it. I’ll tell you
how it was.</p>

<p>“I’ll show Uncle Wiggily that I can go faster
than his airship!” laughed Dr. Possum to himself,
as he started out from his office. “I’ll take
a short cut through the woods and get there
first, airship or no airship.”</p>

<p>Well, he took the short cut all right, but when
he came to a mud puddle and tried to jump over,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
he slipped, and down he came in it with both hind
feet.</p>

<p>And the mud was so sticky that Dr. Possum
was stuck there. No matter how he pulled he
could not pull himself loose.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is terrible!” he cried. “I may have
to stay here all night, and I can’t cure poor, sick
Jimmie. This is very sad!”</p>

<p>And it was there, stuck in the mud puddle, that
Uncle Wiggily found Dr. Possum.</p>

<p>“Oh, ho!” cried the rabbit gentleman. “So
there you are!” and he looked down on the
animal docter from overhead in his airship.</p>

<p>“Oh, please help me out!” cried Dr. Possum.</p>

<p>“Of course I will,” said Uncle Wiggily.
“I’ll drop you a piece of clothesline. Fasten it
about your waist and I’ll tie one end up here on
the clothesbasket and pull you out by my airship.”</p>

<p>When the clothesline was fast around Dr. Possum,
Uncle Wiggily made the electric fan wheel
of the airship go very fast and hard. And then
slowly at first, but soon faster and faster, out of
the mud Dr. Possum was pulled by the clothesline.</p>

<p>“Now I guess I’d better take you the rest of
the way to the Wibblewobble house in this airship,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
then you won’t get stuck in the mud again,”
said Uncle Wiggily, kindly.</p>

<p>“I guess so,” said Dr. Possum. And when he
reached Jimmie’s house he soon cured the duck
boy. Then Mrs. Wibblewobble helped wash the
mud off the animal physician, and Dr. Possum
rode home again in Uncle Wiggily’s airship.</p>

<p>“Airships are better and more useful than I
thought,” said Dr. Possum, as he got out.</p>

<p>“You are just like Grandfather Goosey
Gander,” said Uncle Wiggily with a laugh.
“You have changed your mind.”</p>

<p>So that’s how the rabbit gentleman helped his
friend, and on the next page, if the man beating
rugs in our back yard doesn’t put the clothes
post in his pocket and take it away for an
umbrella handle, I’ll tell you about Uncle Wiggily
and the moth balls.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="STORY_VII">STORY VII<br>
<span class="fs70">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE MOTH BALLS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“There it goes! Get it!” suddenly cried
Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady, one
night, making a jump up from the rocking chair
where she was sitting, sewing up the holes in the
coffee strainer.</p>

<p>“My goodness me sakes alive and some cheese
pudding!” cried Uncle Wiggily Longears, the
rabbit gentleman, who was reading the evening
paper in his hollow stump bungalow near the
underground house. “Have you dropped your
ball of yarn, Nurse Jane, or did you see Jilly
Longtail, the mousie?”</p>

<p>“Neither one,” answered Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy,
who kept house for Uncle Wiggily. “Oh, there’s
another! Hit it quick before it gets upstairs!”
she cried, making a grab for something in the
air.</p>

<p>“Well, this is certainly surprising!” Uncle
Wiggily exclaimed. “I see nothing!”</p>

<p>He looked at Nurse Jane, who was making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
funny motions in the air, waving her paws about
and clapping them together.</p>

<p>“You don’t see anything?” the muskrat lady
cried. “Why, the place is full of moths. They
will eat everything up!”</p>

<p>“Will they eat up my turnip sandwich?”
Uncle Wiggily wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Oh, not that,” replied Nurse Jane. “They
are not like foxes, or bears. Moths are little
things that first flit about like butterflies. Then
they find a nice, cosy, soft bed in your fur coat,
or your flannel shirts, and they lay eggs. Then
out of the egg comes a little insect that eats up
the fur and flannel. They even eat pianos!”</p>

<p>“My gracious!” cried Uncle Wiggily.
“They must be regular giants to eat pianos! I
never heard of such a thing!”</p>

<p>“Well, of course they don’t exactly eat the
whole piano,” said Nurse Jane, as she made another
grab in the air, trying to catch the moth-butterfly.
But she missed it and knocked off
Uncle Wiggily’s spectacles. Very luckily, however,
the glasses fell on the soft back of Kittie
Kat, who had come over to Uncle Wiggily’s
house to borrow a cup of flour to make a bouquet
for her school teacher, and so the glasses were
not broken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>“Moths must be terrible things!” said Uncle
Wiggily, as he put on his spectacles again.
“Fancy, now; eating pianos!”</p>

<p>“Well, I mean they eat the felt cloth inside the
pianos, and so spoil them for playing,” went on
Nurse Jane. “But we must get busy, Uncle
Wiggily. To-morrow you must go up in your
airship and buy me some moth balls.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know moths played ball,” said the
rabbit gentleman. “They certainly are strange
creatures, to eat pianos and play ball!”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course, moths don’t play ball!” Nurse
Jane said. “How silly you are, Wiggily. Moth
balls are white balls that smell very strongly of
camphor and other things that moths do not like.
If you put moth balls in your fur and flannels the
moths will go away.”</p>

<p>“Where will they go?” asked Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Please don’t ask so many
questions,” Nurse Jane answered, as she tried to
catch another moth. And this time she stepped
on Kittie’s tail and the little cat girl meaowed:
said:</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! I guess I had better go home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, please excuse me!” begged Nurse Jane.
“But I must get these moths out of the way.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get the moth balls to-morrow,” Uncle
Wiggily promised, “and if there are any balls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
left over I will give them to Sammie Littletail to
play marbles with.”</p>

<p>“Well, the next day the old rabbit gentleman
started off in his airship to get the moth balls for
Nurse Jane. He found them in a drug store,
and the monkey gentleman who kept the place
put the white balls in a box for Uncle Wiggily,
so he could easily carry them.</p>

<p>“I hope you have no trouble, going back in
your airship,” said the monkey gentleman,
politely.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Uncle Wiggily. “I think
I shall be all right.” Then he sailed back toward
his house with the moth balls, and on the way he
heard down below him some voices saying:</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! Isn’t it too bad?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if we only had some marbles we could
have a nice game!”</p>

<p>“But we haven’t any!” cried a third voice,
sadly.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily looked down, and in the schoolyard,
over which he was flying in his airship, he
saw Sammie Littletail, the rabbit boy, Bully and
Bawly No-Tail, the frogs, Jackie and Peetie
Bow-Wow, the puppies, and many other animal
friends. They wanted to have a game of marbles,
but could not.</p>

<p>“I’ll just drop them down a few of the moth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
balls; I have plenty,” said Uncle Wiggily. So
he did, taking care not to let any of the balls fall
on the animal boys.</p>

<p>“Oh joy!” the little chaps cried, when they
saw the white balls. “These will make fine
marbles!” And they had a great game.</p>

<p>A little farther along Uncle Wiggily saw some
toy wooden soldiers who were going to shoot their
pop guns at a mark for practice, so that they
might become good marksmen in time of war.</p>

<p>“Oh, but alas and alack!” cried the captain.
“I forgot to bring any bullets. What shall I
do?”</p>

<p>“Ha! Perhaps these will answer!” cried
Uncle Wiggily, and the rabbit gentleman
dropped down some more moth balls from his airship.</p>

<p>“Oh, how kind are you!” cried the soldier captain.
Then his soldiers loaded their guns with the
white moth ball bullets and shot at the mosquito
targets as much as they pleased.</p>

<p>Then, a little farther on, Uncle Wiggily saw
a bad old lion chasing after a poor little dog.
And the lion was going to pull the doggie’s tail,
for all I know. Mind, I’m not saying for sure,
but maybe.</p>

<p>“Ha! This will never do!” cried the rabbit
gentleman. “I must stop that lion.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>So he threw the rest of the moth balls out of his
airship at the lion. And the balls hit the bad
creature on the nose and the lion cried, “Wow!
Wow! Wow!” three times, just like that, and
then he had to go to the dentist’s to have his nose
fixed. So he didn’t chase the doggie any more.</p>

<p>“But where are the moth balls?” asked Nurse
Jane, when Uncle Wiggily reached home in his
airship. And when he told her what he had done
with them she said: “Well, you were very kind,
of course, but I guess I had better get the moth
balls myself next time.”</p>

<p>And she did, and she put Uncle Wiggily’s fur
coat away in them, and no moths tried to eat
it at all. And, in the next story, if the stovepipe
takes the refrigerator out to see the circus
elephant jump over the back fence, I’ll tell you
about Uncle Wiggily and the dentist.</p>

<span class="fs70">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE DENTIST</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Uncle Wiggily Longears, the old gentleman
rabbit, was out taking a sail among the
clouds in his airship, made from a clothes basket,
some toy circus balloons, a Japanese umbrella
and an electric fan, that went whizzie-izzie.</p>

<p>“Well, I wonder what will happen to me to-day?”
Uncle Wiggily said to himself, as he
steered out of the way of a thunderstorm that was
having a race with a black cloud. “I suppose I
shall have some sort of an adventure.”</p>

<p>And, surely enough he did, and I am going to
have the pleasure of telling you all about it; that
is, if you care to listen, as the telephone girl says.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily was sailing along, flying over
the tops of the houses and the trees in animal
land, when, all at once, as he fluttered in his airship
above the burrow, or underground house
where Sammie Littletail, the rabbit boy lived,
Mr. Longears heard a voice crying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, mamma! But I don’t want to go! I
can’t go! I know it will hurt too much!”</p>

<p>“Silly boy!” said Mrs. Longtail, the rabbit
lady. “Would you rather have the toothache
than go to the dentist’s and have him take it
away?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean take the toothache away or the
tooth, mamma?” asked Sammie, curious like.</p>

<p>“Both,” answered Mrs. Littletail, with a
smile.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not going!” yelled Sammie.</p>

<p>“Ha! There is trouble down there,” said
Uncle Wiggily, as he listened to this talk. “I
guess perhaps I had better go down and see what
I can do.”</p>

<p>So down he went in his airship to the home of
the Littletail rabbit family, and there, indeed, he
found trouble. Sammie had the toothache, from
eating too many carrot ice cream cones, and as
the tooth was an old one, with a big hole in it, that
tooth needed to be pulled.</p>

<p>“But I won’t go to the dentist’s!” howled
Sammie. Sometimes boy animals, and real boys,
too, are that way. It takes girls to go to the
dentist. They don’t mind a bit. All they’re
afraid of is that their hair ribbons may get bent,
or twisted, but they are easily fixed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll not go,” said Sammie, and he cried real
hard.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” exclaimed Mrs. Littletail.
“Whatever shall I do with you?”</p>

<p>“Ha! Perhaps I can help you!” exclaimed
Uncle Wiggily, as he came sailing gently down
in his airship. “Sammie, you come for a ride
with me, and perhaps everything will be all right.
Come in my airship.”</p>

<p>“Are we going to the dentist’s?” asked the
rabbit boy.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll just stop in and see how he is,”
said Uncle Wiggily. “Perhaps he may have a
new way of pulling teeth that won’t hurt you the
least mite.”</p>

<p>Well, at first Sammie did not want to go, but
finally he said he would, and into the airship he
got with Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>Up near the clouds they went, sailing along
until they came to the hollow stump office of the
dentist, who was a bear gentleman, with long
claws, just made on purpose for pulling out the
aching teeth of the animal people.</p>

<p>“Here is my nephew, Sammie Littletail, the
rabbit boy,” said Uncle Wiggily to the dentist
bear. “He has an aching tooth!”</p>

<p>“And I want it pulled, but I am afraid it will
hurt too much,” cried Sammie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, nonsensicalness!” exclaimed the dentist
bear. “I can pull teeth without anyone knowing
it. Now did you ever tie a string around your
tooth, and then fasten a flatiron to the other end
of the string, and let the iron drop out of the window?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Sammie, “I have done that, and
every time the flatiron dropped the tooth came
out, also. But it hurt!”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe a little bit,” said the dentist
bear. “But did you ever tie a string to the tooth
you wanted pulled, and then tie the other end of
the string to the door-knob, and have some one
open the door suddenly, when you didn’t know it;
ever do that?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Sammie, “I did. And the tooth
came out that time, too.”</p>

<p>“Then we shall have to try a new way,” said
the dentist bear. “Just let me tie a string to
your tooth, and we shall see what happens.”</p>

<p>“You won’t pull it; will you?” asked the rabbit
boy.</p>

<p>“No, I won’t pull it,” answered the dentist
bear, as he blinked both his eyes at Uncle Wiggily
sort of funny like.</p>

<p>So Sammie tied the string to his aching tooth;
a good long strong string it was. The dentist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
took the other end of the cord and dropped it out
of the window.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” asked Sammie.</p>

<p>“You’ll see, in a minute,” answered the dentist.
“Here, you just look at this picture book
for awhile,” and he gave Sammie one with many
prettily colored pictures in.</p>

<p>Well, when Sammie was looking at the picture
book, the dentist took the loose end of the string,
that was on the rabbit boy’s tooth, and tied it to
Uncle Wiggily’s airship; tied the string I mean,
not the tooth.</p>

<p>“Now,” whispered the nice bear to the rabbit
gentleman, “if you start your airship all of a sudden
you will pull on Sammie’s aching tooth, and
you’ll have it out in a jiffy, which is very quick indeed.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it!” said Uncle Wiggily. So, while
Sammie was sitting there, with the string around
his tooth, looking at the pictures and wondering
what was going to happen, all of a sudden Uncle
Wiggily started the airship. Up it went toward
the clouds, pulling on the string, and the next
minute Sammie felt a tug, and a pull and a yank
and a jerk and, all of a sudden—out came his
aching tooth.</p>

<p>“Oh!” he cried, jumping up. “What happened?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>“Your toothache is gone,” said the dentist bear
gentleman. “Uncle Wiggily pulled it away
with his airship.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so glad!” cried Sammie, when it
was all over. “I didn’t know Uncle Wiggily
was a dentist, too.”</p>

<p>Then his toothache stopped and he rode back
home with the rabbit gentleman in the airship,
and everybody was happy. Mrs. Littletail, especially,
for Sammie had been very troublesome,
though he did not mean to be. So this teaches us
that an airship is good for pulling teeth, as well as
for sailing up in the clouds.</p>

<p>And on the next page, if the pussy cat doesn’t
fall out of the cherry tree and scratch the covers
off the pansy bed, where the puppy dog sleeps,
I’ll tell you about Uncle Wiggily and the grocery
cat.</p>

<span class="fs70">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE GROCERY CAT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Uncle Wiggily, the nice old gentleman rabbit,
was working away out in the yard fixing his
airship. He had been riding around in it a great
deal of late, sailing up among the clouds, taking
it out in rain storms, and once he even sailed in it
across the duck pond, coming right down into the
water with it.</p>

<p>And in doing all these things one of the handles
of the clothes basket, which was part of the airship,
had become bent and twisted. And some of
the toy circus balloons needed to be blown up
with fresh air, and there was a hole in the Japanese
umbrella, which formed the top part of the
airship, to keep the sun off Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>“Yes, I must fix up my airship,” said the rabbit
gentleman as he worked away, whistling and
twinkling his nose at the same time, like a star on
a frosty night.</p>

<p>And that is very hard to do—to whistle and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
twinkle your nose at the same time. If you do
not believe me just try it yourself and see.</p>

<p>“Have you any more sofa cushions I could
take for my airship, Nurse Jane?” asked Uncle
Wiggily, going into the house where the muskrat
lady housekeeper was boiling some carrots to
make a lemon pie.</p>

<p>“Sofa cushions?” Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy
cried. “What in the world do you want of more
sofa cushions?”</p>

<p>“To make another seat in the clothes basket
of my airship,” answered the rabbit gentleman.
“You see, I have room for two persons in it, and
perhaps even three more of my animal friends, if
we squeezed up a bit, but I need more sofa cushions
to make a soft place for my company to land
on in case we fall.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess we have a few cushions left,”
said the muskrat lady. “But, please, don’t lose
them.”</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily said he wouldn’t and soon he
had his airship all fixed up with two nicely cushioned
seats in it. Then he went back in the
house to get a turnip cookie, with cocoanut
sprinkled on the bottom, and he asked of Miss
Fuzzy Wuzzy, most politely:</p>

<p>“Won’t you come and take a ride in my airship,
Nurse Jane?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, my goodness me, sakes alive and some
fried soap bubbles!” cried the muskrat lady, surprised
like. “No, indeed, thank you! I should
be dreadfully afraid.”</p>

<p>“There is no danger at all,” Uncle Wiggily
said, but Nurse Jane would not come out in the
airship with him, and the rabbit gentleman had
to go sailing all alone by himself.</p>

<p>Up into the air he soared, looking down on the
tree tops, and he wished he had some one with
him, for he was lonesome, Uncle Wiggily was.
But Charlie and Arabella Chick, the hen lady’s
children, were at school, and so were Sammie and
Susie Littletail, the rabbits, and Johnnie and
Billie Bushytail, the squirrels. In fact Bully
and Bawly No-Tail, the frog boys, and all the
animal children were at school.</p>

<p>“I guess I can find no one to ride with me to-day,”
sadly said Uncle Wiggily, after he had
called on Grandfather Goosey Gander and found
that the old goose gentleman had gone fishing
after snails. Dr. Possum, on whom the old rabbit
gentleman also called, was busy looking after
the ill animals, so of course Dr. Possum could
not go.</p>

<p>Well, Uncle Wiggily was getting more and
more lonesome, and he was thinking of going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
back home, when, all of a sudden, down on the
ground below him he heard some one saying:</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! Isn’t it too bad! Oh, such bad
luck! and they want these things for the party,
too! Oh, sorrow! Oh, unhappiness! Oh, woe
is me!”</p>

<p>“My, some one must be having a whole bushel
of trouble, and then some more,” said Uncle
Wiggily, sort of surprised like. “I must see
what this is.”</p>

<p>He made his airship go slowly down toward
the ground, and then the rabbit gentleman saw
the delivery boy grocery cat standing near an
old stump, and looking down at a broken basket,
that had been filled with things from the store.
But the things were all spilled now.</p>

<p>“Ha! What is the matter, Tom?” asked
Uncle Wiggily of the grocery cat. You see the
cat’s name was Tom, and he worked at delivering
groceries from the grocery store.</p>

<p>“Oh, I have such a lot of trouble,” said Tom.
“As I was going along with the groceries just
now, my basket handle broke, one of the sides
slipped out, and the groceries spilled all over.”</p>

<p>“That is too bad,” said Uncle Wiggily kindly,
as he made his airship go all the way down to the
ground.</p>

<p>“And the worst of it is,” went on Tom, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
grocery cat, “that the basket is so broken that I
can’t use it again. I have no other and Mrs.
Wibblewobble, the duck lady, is in a hurry for
these things. She wants them for a party she
is getting up for Lulu, Alice and Jimmie. Oh,
isn’t it too bad!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it might be worse,” said Uncle
Wiggily, cheerfully. “Nothing is so bad but
what it could be worse.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how,” spoke Tom, the grocery
cat. “I can’t deliver these things, and Mrs.
Wibblewobble will be so disappointed, and so
will Lulu and Alice and Jimmie.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it might easily be worse,” laughed Uncle
Wiggily, as he twinkled his nose twice and once
more. “I might not have come along in my airship
to help you. But here I am, and I have just
put a new cushioned seat in the clothes basket,
on purpose to give some one a ride.</p>

<p>“Now you get right in with me, and pile in
the groceries. Never mind the broken basket.
I’ll take you to Mrs. Wibblewobble’s house as
fast as anything, and then you can deliver the
groceries.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how kind you are!” cried Tom. In a
second he had his groceries packed in Uncle
Wiggily’s clothes basket airship. Then he and
the old rabbit gentleman took their seats, up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
went the airship, around went the electric fan and
pretty soon they were over the home of Mrs.
Wibblewobble, the duck lady.</p>

<p>“Groceries!” cried Tom the cat, just as if he
were at the back door, and when Uncle Wiggily
lowered his airship, the things for the party were
put on the back stoop. And wasn’t the duck
lady surprised to see the groceries from the store
come in an airship? Well, I guess she was!
But she was delighted, too!</p>

<p>Then Tom, the grocery cat, thanked Uncle
Wiggily again for helping him, and the rabbit
gentleman took Tom back to the store, where he
got a new basket, and everybody was happy.</p>

<p>And on the next page, if our piano doesn’t go
out to a phonograph party and forget to come
home to breakfast, I’ll tell you about Uncle Wiggily
and the smoky chimney.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="STORY_X">STORY X<br>
<span class="fs70">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE SMOKY CHIMNEY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Once upon a time there was a Flump, who
lived in animal land, not far from where Uncle
Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman, had his
hollow stump bungalow with nurse Jane Fuzzy
Wuzzy, the muskrat lady. This Flump lived in
a house all by herhimself, and heshe was not a
very pleasant sort of an animal.</p>

<p>You see, a Flump is sometimes a he and sometimes
a she, so I have to mix up the words. And
another thing—a Flump is always sad and cross
and unhappy, and tries to make others unhappy,
too. So, whatever you are, please, please, please
never be a Flump.</p>

<p>A Flump can never see anything good in anything
or anybody. Gracious, if there were many
Flumps in this world it would be a dreadful place
in which to live.</p>

<p>For instance, a Flump doesn’t like to see
children playing tag and running about, and a
Flump doesn’t like to hear children laugh and
shout. If the Flumps had their way it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
always be dark and bedtime, and everybody
would go in their houses and shut themselves up
and be gloomy and sad. There never would be
any Christmas or Fourth of July, and school
would always be in, with no recess, and there
wouldn’t be any ice cream cones, or merry-go-rounds,
or peanuts, or toy balloons, or circus-lemonade,
or anything like that.</p>

<p>However, thank goodness, there aren’t many
Flumps in the world. But, I am sorry to say,
one lived near Uncle Wiggily. And one day
when the old gentleman rabbit was sailing around
in his airship he happened to land on the ground
close by the house of this Flump.</p>

<p>Some of the wind came out of the toy circus
balloons that Uncle Wiggily had fastened on his
clothes basket airship, and the rabbit gentleman
came down to blow more air in them.</p>

<p>The Flump saw him, and coming out of herhis
house, with a sad, gloomy face, the Flump said,
most dolefully and sorrowfully:</p>

<p>“Oh, why do you waste your time riding
around in your airship, Mr. Longears? Why do
you waste your time?”</p>

<p>“I do not waste my time,” said the rabbit gentleman
cheerfully. “I ride about, it is true, but
whenever I see any one in trouble I help them if
I can.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, yes, but how much better,” said the
Flump, “how much better it would be if you
would sell your airship and put the money away
where you would always have it. Then you could
stay in the house all day and be sad, as I am. Oh,
I love to be sad.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Uncle Wiggily, “I guess you do!
You look it! But I do not like to be sad. I like
to be happy and make others happy if I can.”</p>

<p>“Happy!” cried the Flump. “There is no
such thing as happiness! All is sad and gloom!
See, it is getting dark. It will soon be night, and
I’ll be glad, for then every one will have to go to
bed.”</p>

<p>“No, it is not getting night,” said Uncle Wiggily;
“that is only the sun going under a cloud.
It will soon come out shining again.” And,
surely enough it did, but the Flump was not
happy.</p>

<p>“I am going in the house and take some bitter
medicine,” said the Flump, sadly like.</p>

<p>“Well, I hope it will do you good,” spoke
Uncle Wiggily, cheerfully and politely.</p>

<p>So the Flump went in herhis gloomy house,
to take hisher bitter sour medicine, and Uncle
Wiggily fixed his airship. Pretty soon, just as
he was about to sail up toward the blue sky, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
the sun was shining, and the birds were singing,
the Flump came running out, crying:</p>

<p>“Oh, woe is me! Oh, unhappiness! I knew
something would happen! My house is on fire!”</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily looked, and, surely enough, a
lot of smoke was pouring out of the doors and
windows of the Flump animal’s house. Thicker
and thicker grew the smoke.</p>

<p>“Yes, there must be a fire!” cried the rabbit
gentleman. “But don’t worry! I’ll call out the
water bug fire department, and we’ll soon make
everything right. Don’t worry!”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I just love to worry!” cried the
Flump. “I am glad I have something about
which to worry! Oh, unhappiness!”</p>

<p>But Uncle Wiggily had no time to worry.
Into his airship he jumped, and off he flew to get
the fire department.</p>

<p>He brought back the brave water bugs with
their buckets of water, but when they had rushed
in the Flump’s house they came out, saying, as
they wiped the smoke out of their eyes:</p>

<p>“There is no fire there!”</p>

<p>“No fire?” cried Uncle Wiggily. “But look
at the smoke.”</p>

<p>“The chimney is stopped up,” said the head
water bug. “There is something in the chimney,
and when the Flump built a fire all the smoke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
came out into the room, instead of going up the
flue.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I knew something was the matter,”
sobbed the Flump. “And I am glad of it. Now
I can be more unhappy than ever.”</p>

<p>“Oh, fie!” cried Uncle Wiggily, twinkling
his nose. “It is wrong to be sad and unhappy!
Besides, I can soon make you happy.”</p>

<p>“How can I be glad when my chimney
smokes?” asked the Flump. “It is all stopped
up.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps we can unstop it,” said the
rabbit gentleman. “We will try.”</p>

<p>The water bugs tried to get whatever it was
out of the chimney, but they could not. Neither
could a policeman dog, who came in, and barked
up the fireplace as hard as he could bark. Then
Uncle Wiggily said:</p>

<p>“I will now use my airship. I’ll go up above
the chimney and poke a long pole down the
chimney hole.” He did this, and a loose brick
that had fallen down the flue, stopping it up, was
poked out by the rabbit gentleman, and then the
chimney did not smoke any more. A fire could
now be built in the stove.</p>

<p>“Be happy now, Flump!” cried Uncle Wiggily,
cheerfully. And all the water bugs cried:</p>

<p>“Yes, be happy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, when the Flump
saw how kind every one was to himher, and how
anxious every one was for herhim to be glad, the
Flump just turned up the corners of hisher
mouth—instead of turning them down—and heshe
took off the dark spectacles shehe wore, and
put on a pair with beautiful rose-colored glasses,
so that all the world looked cheerful, and the
Flump said:</p>

<p>“Yes, I will be glad! I’m sorry I was ever
sad!”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t even be sorry that you were once
sad,” cried Uncle Wiggily, joyfully; “just be
glad you are glad, and don’t ever remember you
were sad!”</p>

<p>“I’ll always be glad now,” went on the
Flump, who turned out to be a nice old lady
Grandmother, after all her troubles were over.
Then she made up a fire in the stove, the chimney
didn’t smoke any more and the Flump made a
big chocolate cake and gave every one some.
And ever after that the Flump was named
Scrump, instead of Flump. For Scrump is
short for scrumptious, which means just lovely,
you know. And Uncle Wiggily took Scrump
for a ride in the airship, and they picked flowers
up in cloudland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>And in the next story, if robin redbreast
doesn’t take our milk bottle for his bath tub and
go picking strawberries off the rose bush, I’ll tell
you about Uncle Wiggily and the church bell.</p>

<span class="fs70">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE CHURCH BELL</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Here is a package for you, Mr. Longears,”
said Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady
housekeeper, as she entered the dining-room,
of the hollow stump bungalow, where the rabbit
gentleman was eating his breakfast right
after supper—the next day, of course.</p>

<p>“A package for me—how nice!” exclaimed
Uncle Wiggily. “Let me see—what day is it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see that it makes any difference,”
spoke Nurse Jane. “A package is a package
any day.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, very true,” admitted Uncle Wiggily.
“But a package on April Fools’ day is quite different
from one on Christmas.”</p>

<p>“So it is,” said the muskrat lady with a laugh.
“But as it happens, this is not April Fools’ day.”</p>

<p>“No, it is not,” admitted Uncle Wiggily, “and
in that case I will open the package. Who
brought it?”</p>

<p>“Billie Bushytail, the squirrel boy, on his way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
to school left it for you,” answered Nurse Jane.</p>

<p>“And from whom did it come?” Uncle Wiggily
wanted to know.</p>

<p>“You had better open it and see,” suggested
Nurse Jane.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily did so, and what do you s’pose
he found? Why in the package was a lovely
chocolate cake, with cocoanut on top, and a yellow
carrot in the middle. And there was a little
card on which was written:</p>

<p>“From the Scrump, who used to be a Flump,
to Dear Uncle Wiggily.”</p>

<p>“Ha!” exclaimed the old gentleman rabbit.
“This is very nice. I am glad I helped change
the Flump into a Scrump.”</p>

<p>I told you that story on the page before this,
you remember. The Flump was a curious, sad
sort of a mixed-up animal, but when Uncle Wiggily
fixed her smoky chimney, the Flump turned
into a Scrump, which is short for Scrumptious,
and scrumptious means lovely.</p>

<p>“My! that is good chocolate cake,” said the
gentleman rabbit, passing Nurse Jane a large
slice. “Just give it away to the animal children
when they come home from school.”</p>

<p>“That’s just like you!” cried the muskrat
lady. “Giving away everything you get! Why
don’t you eat it yourself?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>“I had rather see others eat it,” replied Uncle
Wiggily. And I might say that if ever you feel
yourself turning into a Flump, just start giving
things away, or making others happy, and you’ll
become a Scrump right away. And it’s much
nicer to be a Scrump than a Flump.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” asked Nurse Jane,
as Uncle Wiggily got up from the table.</p>

<p>“Out for a ride in my airship,” replied the
rabbit gentleman. “It is a lovely day, and I
might find some in trouble whom I could help.
Yes, I shall go for a little ride.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t fall,” begged Nurse Jane, and
Uncle Wiggily promised that he would not.
Soon he was soaring and flying up near the
clouds in his airship, that was made from a clothes
basket, some circus balloons, a Japanese umbrella
and an electric fan.</p>

<p>Pretty soon, in a little while, not so very long,
Uncle Wiggily heard, down on the earth, some
one saying most sadly:</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! Now I am in trouble!”</p>

<p>“My! I wonder if that’s Tom, the grocery
cat, who has another broken basket?” said Uncle
Wiggily to himself. “If it is I must help him.”</p>

<p>He looked down and found that, right under
him, was a big church with a steeple and in front
of the church was the sexton, or janitor, a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
nice man, indeed, if you will kindly allow me to
say so.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! Such trouble!” cried the sexton
man, sadly.</p>

<p>“What is the trouble?” asked Uncle Wiggily
kindly, as he lowered his airship. “Perhaps I
can help you.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” answered the janitor.
“You see, the rope by which I pull the church
bell is broken. To-morrow is Sunday and I have
not time to mend the rope. I can’t ring the bell,
and unless I do make it jingle ding-dong, the
people will not hear it and will not come to
church.”</p>

<p>“Ha! That is too bad!” agreed Uncle Wiggily.
“For going to church does every one good.
But won’t they come even if the bell doesn’t
ring?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid not,” said the sexton man.
“You see, the bell has been rung every Sunday
for years and years and years. The people have
become used to it. They don’t even look at their
clocks, but when they hear the bell go ‘ding-dong!’
they say: ‘Ah! it is time to go to church.’
But now, alas, the rope is broken and I will not
be able to ring the Sunday bell to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” said Uncle Wiggily, with a
laugh. “And don’t be gloomy like a Flump,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
whatever happens. Perhaps I may be able to
help you.”</p>

<p>But the sexton man did not think so, and he
was quite sad. He tried to fix the bell rope, but
he could not, and it looked as though the bell
would not ring for Sunday church.</p>

<p>But what did Uncle Wiggily do? Listen, as
the telephone girl says, and I will tell you. Sunday
morning, bright and early, the rabbit gentleman
took a lot of stones in the clothes basket and
he went sailing up in his airship.</p>

<p>Right up over the church spire he sailed, and
he hovered over the steeple and the bell, and,
when it was time for church, the rabbit gentleman
threw stones at the bell. And, as he was a good
shot, he hit it every time.</p>

<p>“Crack!” went a stone on the bell, and the bell
went “Ding-dong! Ding-dong!” slowly and
solemn-like. More stones did Uncle Wiggily
throw from his airship, and every time the rabbit
gentleman hit it the bell rang just as well as
though the sexton had pulled the rope.</p>

<p>“Ha!” cried all the people. “There goes the
bell! It is time for church!”</p>

<p>So they went, and were not late, but they
were much surprised when they saw Uncle Wiggily
in his airship, throwing stones at the bell to
ring it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>And when all the people were in their seats,
Uncle Wiggily didn’t have to ring the bell any
more. He came down out of his airship and went
to church himself, and everybody was happy, and
the sexton was most especially thankful to the
rabbit gentleman.</p>

<p>So that’s all now, if you please, but next, if
my typewriter doesn’t go in swimming and get
its hair ribbon all wet, so it’s as crinkly as a corkscrew,
I’ll tell you about Uncle Wiggily and the
doll’s house.</p>

<span class="fs70">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE DOLL HOUSE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Oh, I’m so happy! So happy,” sang Susie
Littletail, the rabbit girl, as she hopped on her
way home from school one afternoon.</p>

<p>“Why are you so happy?” asked Lulu Wibblewobble,
the duck girl, as she picked up a stone
in her webbed foot and tossed it into the pond.
I mean she tossed the stone—not her foot. Lulu
could throw a stone almost as good as a boy.</p>

<p>“Why, I am happy because my papa is going
to give me a doll house for my birthday, which
is to-morrow,” went on Susie. “Oh, it is the
loveliest doll house! I saw it in a toy-store window,
and papa is going to get it for me.”</p>

<p>“I wish I had a doll house,” spoke Lulu, sadly
like.</p>

<p>“I’ll let you play with mine,” Susie answered.
“It is a large one, with room for two dolls, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, so much!” exclaimed Lulu,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
and then she and Susie hurried on, stopping only
to pick a few wild flowers that grew by the path
which turned and twisted through the woods.</p>

<p>“When am I going to get my doll house,
papa?” asked Susie at the supper table that evening.</p>

<p>“I will have it for you when I come home to-morrow
night,” promised the rabbit gentleman.
“I am having some of the rooms papered for
you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how lovely!” cried Susie, clapping her
paws.</p>

<p>The lady mouse teacher at the hollow stump
school, where the little rabbit girl and all the other
animal children attended, allowed Susie to come
home early on her birthday, and Susie ran all the
way.</p>

<p>“I’m so anxious to see my doll house!” cried
Susie.</p>

<p>But, here comes the sad part of the story. I’ll
make it as short as I can, though.</p>

<p>When Susie reached her house she saw her
papa sitting out on the front porch. He was all
scratched up, and one of his ears was bent over
backward, and his white fur was all dirt, and he
looked very sad.</p>

<p>“Oh, papa!” cried Susie. “What has happened?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, alas! Likewise sorrowfulness! Oh, woe
is me!” said Mr. Littletail, sadly like.</p>

<p>“Oh, tell me, please!” begged Susie, clasping
her paws.</p>

<p>“I have lost your birthday doll house, Susie,”
said her papa. “I was bringing it home through
the greenwood forest, and when I crossed the
bridge over the deep, dark valley, the bridge
broke, and I nearly fell with it. I lost hold of the
doll house, and down it went into the deep, dark
valley.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how sad!” cried Susie.</p>

<p>“I tried to save the doll house from falling,”
went on Mr. Littletail, “but I could not. I
slipped and stumbled myself, when the bridge
gave way; and I am scratched up. But I would
not mind that if I could have saved your doll
house for you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa dear! I am so sorry you are
hurt!” sobbed Susie. “I don’t mind about the
doll house—that is, not much,” she said, and she
put her paws around her papa’s neck and kissed
him.</p>

<p>But, all the same, Susie did mind dreadfully
about her lost play-toy. And Mr. Littletail told
over and over again how the bridge across
the deep, dark valley, (which bridge had been
partly washed away by the rain) had snapped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
and cracked as he was hurrying over it with the
doll house.</p>

<p>“But I have a birthday cake for you, with ten
carrot candles on,” said Mrs. Littletail, and Susie
felt a little happy over that. But, most of all, she
wanted her doll house.</p>

<p>“Maybe I can get it for you,” said Susie’s
brother Sammie, kindly, when he heard about the
trouble. “Come, we will go to the deep, dark
valley and see.”</p>

<p>So the rabbit children went to the greenwood
forest, but they could not even see the bottom
of the valley, or big hole in the ground, between
the high rocky walls. And much less could they
spy the doll house.</p>

<p>“It is gone forever,” said Susie, sadly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am afraid I could not get down there
and bring the doll house up for you,” spoke Sammie.
For the rocky sides of the deep, dark
valley were very steep, like the roof of a house,
and if Sammie went into the deep place he could
hardly ever get out again.</p>

<p>“Oh, my lovely birthday doll house, that I’ll
never see, or have!” sobbed Susie, as she looked
down into the dark hole where her play-toy was,
but where it could not be reached.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe papa will get you another,”
said Sammie, kindly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I’m afraid not! Oh, dear! How sad!”
cried Susie, as she and her rabbit brother started
for home.</p>

<p>“Ha! What is all this about? What seems
to be the trouble?” suddenly asked a voice, up in
the air, and, looking over their heads, Sammie
and Susie saw Uncle Wiggily Longears, the rabbit
gentleman, in his airship. The airship, as I
have told you, was made from a clothes basket,
with circus balloons to raise it up in the air.
Uncle Wiggily sat on sofa cushions in the basket.
“What is the trouble?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, papa accidentally dropped my toy doll
house down in the deep, dark valley!” said Susie.
“We can never get it out.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes we can!” cried Uncle Wiggily in his
jolly voice. “I can lower my airship down into
the valley, and I will, and I’ll get your doll house,
Susie! You just watch me!”</p>

<p>“But it’s so dark you can’t see it,” spoke
Sammie.</p>

<p>“I’ll light a Christmas tree candle,” said
Uncle Wiggily, and so he did. Down into the
deep, dark valley he steered his airship, and by
the light of the candle he saw the doll house. It
had fallen on a big pile of leaves, and wasn’t hurt
a mite. Uncle Wiggily carefully lifted the play-toy
into his airship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>“Here you are, Susie!” cried Uncle Wiggily,
as he floated up out of the valley, and gave the
little rabbit girl her birthday doll house. “I told
you I’d get it back for you!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you dear Uncle Wiggily!” cried Susie,
as she hugged and kissed him. Then she and
Sammie took the doll house home, and Susie and
Lulu Wibblewobble, the duck girl, had much fun
playing with it, and were very happy.</p>

<p>And Uncle Wiggily went on sailing in his airship,
and he had another adventure. I’ll tell you
about it on the page after this, when, in case the
ink bottle doesn’t go to sleep on the white bed
spread, and make a mark like an ice cream cone,
the story will be about Uncle Wiggily and the
bird seed.</p>

<span class="fs70">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE BIRD SEED</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Uncle Wiggily, are you going any place
special this morning?” asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy
Wuzzy, the housekeeper muskrat lady, as she
came out in the yard where the rabbit gentleman
was giving his airship a drink of molasses, so it
would not sail too fast.</p>

<p>“Anywhere special?” repeated Uncle Wiggily,
sort of thoughtful like; “why, no, Nurse
Jane, to tell you the truth, I am merely going
for a little sort of vacation sail around the clouds,
and perhaps I may find an adventure. Did you
want me to do anything for you, Miss Fuzzy
Wuzzy?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, if you will be so kind,” replied the
muskrat lady, as she tied her tail in a double bow
knot, so that it would not drag on the floor when
she was sweeping. “I wish you would stop at
the drug store, Uncle Wiggily, and get me some
bird seed. My pet cat is hungry and I want to
feed it.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="p084" style="max-width: 38.5625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p084.jpg" alt="Uncle Wiggily in airship with birds">
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>“Very well, I will get the bird seed for you,”
spoke the rabbit gentleman politely, “though I
never before heard of feeding it to a cat; never!”
he said, slowly wagging his ears to and fro.</p>

<p>“Well, I have a reason for it,” said Nurse
Jane. “You see, my cat used to catch and eat
the dear little birds, and that made me feel sad.
So I thought perhaps if I could teach my cat to
eat the bird seed, instead of the birds, it would
be better. And so I did. And now, Muffins,
my black cat, would rather have bird seed to eat
any day than the dear birds that sing so sweetly.”</p>

<p>“A fine idea!” cried Uncle Wiggily. “I wish
more cats ate bird seed. I will get you a large
package at the drug store.”</p>

<p>So off Uncle Wiggily started in his airship, the
electric fan at the back, by which it was pushed
along through the clouds, going around whizzie-izzie,
as fast as an egg beater.</p>

<p>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily, where are you going?”
asked Billie Bushytail, the boy squirrel, in the
top of a tall tree as the rabbit gentleman sailed
over it in his airship. “Please give me a ride!”
begged Billie.</p>

<p>“I will give you a ride as far as your school;
you and your brother Johnnie,” said Uncle Wiggily,
kindly. “Then I must sail on to the drug
store to get the bird seed for Nurse Jane.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>“Oh! Is she going to plant the bird seed
in the garden and raise canary birds?” asked
Johnnie, as he scrambled up to the top of the tree
to hop in the airship, and get a ride.</p>

<p>“No, Nurse Jane is going to feed it to her cat,
which eats bird seed instead of birds,” replied the
rabbit gentleman, as he called “Whoa!” to his
airship, and made it stand still long enough for
Billie and Johnnie to hop in from a tree branch.</p>

<p>“I wish she would teach cats to eat squirrel
seed instead of squirrels,” spoke Johnnie.
“Once a cat ate up a little red squirrel, who was
our cousin.”</p>

<p>“Ah! That was too bad!” cried Uncle Wiggily.
“I will see if the drug store man has any
squirrel seed.”</p>

<p>Off he started in the airship again, taking
Billie and Johnnie to the hollow stump school.
Near there Uncle Wiggily stopped his ship close
to the top of another tall tree, and into that the
squirrel boys leaped, scrambling down to the
ground, just in time for their lessons.</p>

<p>Well, the rabbit gentleman reached the drug
store all right, and bought the bird seed for
Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy.</p>

<p>“And now, have you any squirrel seed?”
asked Uncle Wiggily, as he told why he wanted
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>“I have only nuts for squirrels to eat,” said the
elephant gentleman who kept the drug store.
“You might call that squirrel seed.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll take some,” said Uncle Wiggily,
“and if we can not teach cats to eat the nuts, instead
of the dear little squirrels, I can give the
nuts to Billie and Johnnie. They’ll eat them,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>So, with the bird seed and the nuts, the rabbit
gentleman set off once more in his airship. He
had not sailed very far before he felt himself
growing sleepy.</p>

<p>“Ha! Ho! Hum!” cried Uncle Wiggily,
with a yawn. “I think I will sail down to the
ground, and take a nap. It would not be safe to
go sailing about up in the air while asleep. I
might run into a thunder storm and break something.”</p>

<p>So he guided his airship down to earth, and in
a nice shady place in the woods, the rabbit gentleman
tied his clothes basket to a tree, so it would
not sail up and away when he was asleep, and
then he began to dream.</p>

<p>After a while he awakened, feeling much better,
and when he had stretched his ears and
twinkled his nose, he said:</p>

<p>“Well, now, I guess I’ll sail home again.”</p>

<p>But, when he loosed the ropes that held his airship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
fast, it would not rise up, as it always had
done before.</p>

<p>“Why, what in the world can be the matter?”
asked Uncle Wiggily, and then he looked at the
bunch of toy circus balloons that used to raise his
airship off the earth. And every balloon was as
flat as a pancake! All the hot air had gone out
of them.</p>

<p>“Ha! No wonder I could not rise!” cried
Uncle Wiggily. “I must blow up my balloons!”</p>

<p>But, when he tried, he found the balloons so
full of holes that no air would stay in them. A
bad lot of mosquitoes had come along while Uncle
Wiggily slept, had punctured holes in the rubber
balloons, let out the air, and they were all spoiled.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” cried Uncle Wiggily. “What
shall I do? I never can sail home in my airship!”
Then he happened to think of something. “I
have it!” he cried. “I will scatter some bird
seed on the ground. A lot of birds will see it and
come to eat it. And I will ask them all to take
hold of my airship in their bills at once, and raise
me up by fluttering their wings. Then they can
fly home with me and my airship.”</p>

<p>So Uncle Wiggily did this. He scattered
some of the bird seed on the ground, and Dickie
Chip-Chip, the sparrow boy, and some robins and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
blue birds—more than a thousand of them—came
to eat the seeds. And when the birds had
eaten them Uncle Wiggily asked:</p>

<p>“Will you please fly home with me and my
airship, for my lifting balloons are all full of
holes?”</p>

<p>“Indeed we will, and that right gladly!” answered
the birds, politely. So they lifted Uncle
Wiggily and his airship up in their bills and with
their fluttering wings bore him safely home, and
there was bird seed enough left for Nurse Jane’s
cat.</p>

<p>But the cat would not eat the nuts, so Johnnie
and Billie Bushytail had them to crack. And
that’s all to this story.</p>

<p>However, if the rooster in our back yard
doesn’t crow so loudly that he makes the alarm
clock jump off the mantel, I’ll tell you next
about Uncle Wiggily and the baby rabbit.</p>

<span class="fs70">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE BABY RABBIT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily!” cried Susie, the little
rabbit girl, one afternoon, as she came over to
Mr. Longears’ hollow stump bungalow. “I
wonder if you can guess what came to our burrow
in the night?”</p>

<p>“Let me see,” said Uncle Wiggily, slow and
thoughtful like; “was it a mouse?”</p>

<p>“Nope!” cried Susie, laughing and clapping
her paws.</p>

<p>“Was it a thunder storm?” asked the rabbit
gentleman, sort of puzzled like.</p>

<p>“Nope! I’ll give you one more guess, and
then I’ll tell you,” spoke Susie, laughing more
than ever.</p>

<p>“Was it—er—let me see—you didn’t have a
party come to your house last night, did you,
Susie?”</p>

<p>“No! Oh, I knew you couldn’t guess! It was
a baby rabbit. Sammie and I have a little baby
brother. He came last night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, how fine!” cried Uncle Wiggily, tying
his ears up in a hard knot and then untying them
again. “I must go right over and see it. Come
on, Susie, we’ll go in my airship.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let Susie fall out!” cried Nurse Jane,
the muskrat lady housekeeper, as the old gentleman
rabbit, followed by Susie, went out to the
henhouse, where he kept his clothes basket airship.</p>

<p>“I won’t!” promised Uncle Wiggily, and then
he and Susie sailed off, up near the clouds, over
the fields and woods, to the burrow where Mrs.
Littletail, Susie’s mamma, lived.</p>

<p>“Where is that baby rabbit?” cried Uncle
Wiggily, as he lowered his airship to the ground.
“I must see him.”</p>

<p>“Here he is,” said Mrs. Littletail, proudly,
bringing out the new little baby rabbit. “But
be careful not to squeeze him too hard, as he is
very soft and tender.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll be careful!” said Uncle Wiggily
with a laugh.</p>

<p>Then he took the baby rabbit and toddled him
up and down on his knee, and said “Ootsie-Cootsie!”
and “Tummy-tummy!” and “petsie-etsie!”
You know the way old gentleman always
talk to babies, whether they are animals or
not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>“Isn’t he just too sweet!” cried Susie, as she
stood peeping lovingly at her new baby brother.
“And doesn’t he look just like Sammie?”</p>

<p>“Hu! Do I look like that?” asked Sammie,
standing off to one side, with his paws in his
pockets.</p>

<p>“You did when you were little,” said his
mamma, smiling.</p>

<p>“Ha! Well, I don’t now,” spoke Sammie
sort of thankful like. “Come on, Susie, I’m
going to school—the last bell has almost rung.”</p>

<p>“Wait until I give baby a kiss,” said Susie,
and, when she had done so, she hurried to school
with Sammie.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily stayed with Mrs. Littletail for
some time, and he jiggled and joggled the baby
rabbit up and down on his knee, and talked baby
talk to it, and had just a lovely time as all old
gentleman rabbits do at such times.</p>

<p>After a while Mrs. Littletail said:</p>

<p>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily, I have to go to the store
to get a rattle box for baby rabbit, to amuse him
when he cries! I wonder if you would stay here
and take care of him until I come back!”</p>

<p>“Of course I would, and I’d be glad to—real
proud and happy to do so!” cried Uncle Wiggily.
“Won’t I, baby rabbit? Ootsie-cootsie
’unnin’-cunnin’!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>“Goo!” said the baby rabbit. I guess that
meant “yes” in baby rabbit talk.</p>

<p>So Mrs. Littletail went to the store for a rattle
box for her new bunny baby, and then Uncle
Wiggily jiggled and joggled the little chap up
and down on his knee some more.</p>

<p>“Goo-goo!” said baby rabbit, as cute as anything.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re just too lovely!” cried Uncle
Wiggily, exactly as Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy
might have done.</p>

<p>But, all of a sudden, baby rabbit began to cry.</p>

<p>“Oh, my!” exclaimed Uncle Wiggily sort of
disappointed like. “Hold on if you please!
Don’t do that! Stop it!”</p>

<p>But the more he talked the more the baby
rabbit sobbed.</p>

<p>“Wah! Wah! Wah!” cried the small chap.
“Wah-h-h-h-h-h-h!”</p>

<p>“Oh, my!” shouted Uncle Wiggily. “I guess
I must walk up and down with you!” and he did,
as fast as anything, but the baby rabbit only cried
the harder.</p>

<p>“Ha! Maybe you want me to stand on my
head for you!” said Uncle Wiggily. So he put
the baby in its crib and stood on his head, in a
corner, wiggling his feet in the air. But the
baby rabbit still cried:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>“Wah! Wah! Wah!”</p>

<p>“Oh, come now, be nice!” begged Uncle Wiggily,
looking around for something with which
to amuse the rabbit baby. “I guess you want
your rattle box. I wish Mrs. Littletail would
hurry back.”</p>

<p>“Wah! Wah! Wah!” cried baby rabbit.</p>

<p>“I know what I’ll do!” exclaimed Uncle Wiggily.
“I’ll take you in my airship to Nurse Jane
Fuzzy Wuzzy. She’ll know what to do.”</p>

<p>So, bundling the baby rabbit up in its warm
blankets, the old gentleman rabbit hurried out to
his airship, which he had left standing in the yard.
It had been all fixed since the mosquitoes had
bitten holes in the balloons, and was better than
ever.</p>

<p>“Now we’re all right!” Uncle Wiggily cried,
as he started off through the air. “Nurse Jane
will soon fix you, little fellow!”</p>

<p>“Why, you shouldn’t have brought a new,
little baby rabbit out in your airship,” said the
muskrat lady, when she saw what Uncle Wiggily
had done. “It might take cold.”</p>

<p>“Wah! Wah! Wah!” howled the baby
rabbit.</p>

<p>“Listen to that! I couldn’t make it stop crying,”
said Uncle Wiggily. “I did everything,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
even to making funny faces at it. What do you
do in a case like this?”</p>

<p>“Silly old Uncle Wiggily!” laughed Nurse
Jane. “I guess this little fellow is hungry!”
And, surely enough, when she gave baby rabbit
some warm milk and sugar from a bottle, the
little chap stopped crying at once and went to
sleep.</p>

<p>“Well, I do declare!” cried Uncle Wiggily,
in surprise. “It is so easy when you know how!”
And then, while the baby rabbit slept, Uncle
Wiggily took it home in his airship, and just in
time, too, for Mrs. Littletail had come back with
the rattle box, and she was wondering where in
the world her baby was. Then she thanked Uncle
Wiggily, and put the baby rabbit in its crib, and
that is the end of this story.</p>

<p>But in the next story, if the door knob doesn’t
turn a somersault over the pepper caster and slide
off the table, I’ll tell you about Uncle Wiggily
and the popgun.</p>

<span class="fs70">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE POPGUN</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Uncle Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman,
was out in the yard back of his house,
blowing hot air in the toy circus balloons of his
airship. The balloons would then lift the airship
up in the air, and Uncle Wiggily could sail
around near the clouds, like a bird.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you afraid the airship will some day
go up without you in it?” asked Nurse Jane
Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady, who kept house
for the rabbit gentleman.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, for I always tie my airship fast to
the fence, or a tree, or something like that, until
I am ready to get in it!” he answered.</p>

<p>This time Uncle Wiggily tied his airship, with
a clothesline, to the grape arbor, and he went on
getting the red, green, blue and yellow balloons
more and more full of hot air. The rabbit gentleman
blew the hot air in with a putty blower.</p>

<p>Soon the airship was tugging and tugging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
away at the clothesline, wanting to sail up in the
air, and take the old gentleman rabbit with it for
a sail in the clothes basket, which was filled with
soft cushions. These were taken along so, in
case Uncle Wiggily fell, he would not be bounced
too hard.</p>

<p>But the airship could not go up until the rabbit
gentleman loosed the rope that held it fast.</p>

<p>“And that I’ll do as soon as I go in and wash
my paws and get a carrot sandwich,” the rabbit
gentleman said, when he had finished fixing the
balloons. “Then I’ll go off and see if I can find
an adventure.”</p>

<p>An adventure, you know, is something that
happens to you, like being late for school, and
getting kept in. But I hope you have no such
unpleasant adventure as that. I’d rather you had
a nice one, like finding an ice cream cone rolling
up hill.</p>

<p>Well, Uncle Wiggily went into the house to
wash his paws. He soaped them nicely and also
his face, but, when he went to dry them, he could
not find the towel.</p>

<p>“Oh, Nurse Jane!” he cried. “Come quickly
and get me a towel! There’s some soap in my
eyes!”</p>

<p>“Oh, my goodness me sakes alive and some
apple pudding!” cried Nurse Jane. Then she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
ran in to get a towel for Uncle Wiggily, leaving
the airship in the yard all alone.</p>

<p>And now something is going to happen.</p>

<p>Along came Jocko Kinkytail, the little monkey
boy, on his way to school. Jocko was going to be
late, too. He almost always was late, and the
reason was that he stopped too often along the
road to play and to look at the things he saw.</p>

<p>“Oh, my goodness!” cried Jocko, when he saw
Uncle Wiggily’s airship in the yard, all ready to
sail. “I must look at that!”</p>

<p>Over the fence he scrambled, and he began
looking at the airship, made of a clothes basket,
some toy balloons, a Japanese umbrella and an
electric fan.</p>

<p>“Say! This is fine!” cried Jocko. “I wonder
what keeps it from going up when no one is in
it?” Then he noticed the clothesline rope holding
it down, and he said, “Ah, I see!”</p>

<p>Now Jocko was very curious, and when the
monkey chap saw a knot tied in the holdingdown
rope he at once tried to loosen it. And with
his cunning little fingers Jocko did loosen the
knot.</p>

<p>And then——</p>

<p>Up shot the airship into the air, nearly knocking
the monkey boy down, so suddenly did it
leave the earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, my!” cried Jocko.</p>

<p>“Oh, now you have done it!” exclaimed Nurse
Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, as she came running out of
the house, after having gotten Uncle Wiggily a
towel to wipe the soap out of his eyes.</p>

<p>“What has happened?” asked the rabbit gentleman
himself, as he came hopping out, with his
red white and blue striped barber pole crutch that
Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy had gnawed for him
out of a cornstalk.</p>

<p>“I am very sorry,” spoke Jocko politely, “but
your airship has run away.”</p>

<p>“Run away?” cried Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>“Yes, run away. I loosened the knot in the
rope, and up it went—the airship went up, I
mean—not the rope,” said Jocko politely.</p>

<p>“Yes, so I see,” remarked Uncle Wiggily,
looking upward. And there his airship was floating
high above the trees, and no one was in it,
except the sofa cushions, to bring it down again,
and they could not do it.</p>

<p>“I am very sorry,” said Jocko. “I will see if
I can’t get it down for you.” So he climbed the
tallest tree there was, but still the airship was far
above his reach.</p>

<p>“You can never get it!” cried Nurse Jane
sadly.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I can help you,” spoke an elephant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
gentleman coming along just then. “I used to
be a cowboy in a Wild West show, and perhaps
I can throw my rope lasso up high enough to
get it around the airship and pull it down.”</p>

<p>So he threw his rope lasso with his trunk, but
the airship was still too high for him to reach.</p>

<p>“You will have to get an eagle bird to fly up
and bring it down,” said Nurse Jane Fuzzy
Wuzzy.</p>

<p>“Ha! No! I have a better plan than that!”
cried Uncle Wiggily. “Run over to Sammie
Littletail’s house and get his popgun,” said the
rabbit gentleman to the monkey boy. “I will
put some beans in the popgun, shoot them at the
balloons, burst holes in them to let out the hot
air, and down my airship will come of itself.”</p>

<p>And that’s exactly what Uncle Wiggily did.
With Sammie’s popgun he shot the balloons full
of holes, knowing he could easily mend them
again, and when there was no hot air in them to
hold them up, down came the airship, fluttering
slowly to the earth.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness!” cried Nurse Jane. “You
have your airship again, Uncle Wiggily. Don’t
you ever do that again, Jocko Kinkytail.”</p>

<p>“I guess he won’t,” spoke Uncle Wiggily
kindly, as he began to mend the burst balloons.
And Jocko never did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>And if the rubber plant in our yard doesn’t
stretch over the fence and pick a rose off the
gooseberry bush, I’ll tell you next about Uncle
Wiggily and the butterfly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="STORY_XVI">STORY XVI<br>
<span class="fs70">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE BUTTERFLY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Are you going out in your airship this morning?”
asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy of Uncle
Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman, as he
left the breakfast table one day.</p>

<p>“Well, I did not intend to,” he said. “The
electric fan that goes around whizzie-izze, and
makes me sail through the clouds, is broken, and
I shall have to have it mended. So I am not
going in the airship to-day. Was there anything
you wanted me to do for you?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, there was,” replied the muskrat
lady, as she looked at the end of her tail, to see
if it needed dusting. But it did not, I am glad
to say. “I wish you would bring me a yeast cake
from the store if you are near there. I am going
to bake bread,” said Nurse Jane.</p>

<p>“Most gladly will I bring you a yeast cake,”
spoke Uncle Wiggily, with a low and polite bow.
“Only I will walk after it, instead of going in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
my airship. And, while I am out walking, instead
of airshipping, I will look for an adventure
also.”</p>

<p>“Very good,” answered Nurse Jane, as she
carried the butter out in the hammock where it
could swing and keep cool.</p>

<p>So Uncle Wiggily started off after the yeast
cake and anything else he might find. At first
he went along slowly, and then he hurried along
a little faster, and pretty soon, as he came to a
beautiful white lily, he heard a voice sadly saying:</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! What shall I do? I cannot fly
after honey, and I shall surely die! Oh, woe is
me!”</p>

<p>“Ha! Some one in trouble, I imagine!”
Uncle Wiggily cried, as he looked all about.
But he could see no one. Still he again heard the
voice saying:</p>

<p>“Oh, how I suffer! If only some one would
help me!”</p>

<p>“I will help you,” said Uncle Wiggily, “only
I cannot see you. Where are you, if you
please?”</p>

<p>“Look in the lily!” went on the sad voice, and,
looking, Uncle Wiggily saw within the flower,
which was like a little house, a poor butterfly,
with a broken wing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, that is too bad! How did it happen?”
asked the rabbit gentleman kindly.</p>

<p>“I was caught in a hail storm yesterday,” said
the butterfly, “and the hail stones broke one of
my wings. I managed to flutter to my home in
the lily, but I cannot go out now, as my wing is
too sore. And, if I do not fly around among the
flowers and suck out the honey, on which I live,
I shall surely die.”</p>

<p>“Ha! No, indeed, you will not!” Uncle Wiggily
cried. “I will not let you die. I will help
you. See, I am going now for Dr. Possum, the
animal gentleman who helps us woodland creatures,
and mends broken wings and legs and
everything like that. He will fix your wing for
you, and then as to honey and flowers—well, I
can fix that, too. Just don’t worry any more.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how good you are!” sighed the poor
butterfly.</p>

<p>So Uncle Wiggily hurried after Dr. Possum
and brought him to the lily house, and then while
the butterfly’s broken wing was being mended,
with rose leaves and marshmallow candy, Uncle
Wiggily went to some kind bees whom he knew,
and said:</p>

<p>“Now, dear buzzing bees, a friend of mine—a
butterfly—has broken her wing. She cannot
go fluttering around the flowers, sipping honey.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
So, until her wing is better, will you not, every
day, carry her a little honey to her home in the
white lily?”</p>

<p>“Of course we will!” cried the queen bee.
“Gladly will we do that. Why, my goodness
gracious me sakes alive and some apple blossoms!
I should say we would do a kindness like that!
Wouldn’t we, bees?”</p>

<p>“Buzz! Buzz!” said all the other bees.
“Yes! Yes!”</p>

<p>“Then everything will be all right,” said
Uncle Wiggily. “Thank you!”</p>

<p>He hurried back to the butterfly, whose wing
Dr. Possum had fixed by this time, and the rabbit
gentleman told the poor creature in the lily
how he had arranged for the bees to bring her
honey every day until her wing was healed.</p>

<p>“Oh, you are so good!” she murmured, as she
went to sleep.</p>

<p>“Pray do not mention it,” said Uncle Wiggily,
politely, and then he hurried to the store
for the yeast cake.</p>

<p>Now comes a little sad part to this story, but
I will not make it any longer than I can possibly
help.</p>

<p>About a week after this, Nurse Jane heard
Uncle Wiggily groaning in his bed, and saying:</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! How ill I am. It’s that old rheumatism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
pain again! Please send for Dr. Possum.”</p>

<p>“I will,” said the muskrat lady. And when
Dr. Possum came he said:</p>

<p>“Uncle Wiggily, you are very ill indeed.
You have rheumatism fever, and you must take
bitter medicine, and, since the weather is so warm,
you must have some one fan you every day with
a fan to cool you.”</p>

<p>“But who can do it?” asked the rabbit gentleman.
“Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, my muskrat
housekeeper, is too busy, all my animal children
friends have to go to school, so they can graduate,
and all my other friends are too busy. No one
can come to fan me.”</p>

<p>“What about the electric fan on your airship?”
asked Nurse Jane.</p>

<p>“Alas! that is broken,” said Uncle Wiggily,
and he felt very ill indeed. He needed fanning
then and there.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to do,” spoke Dr. Possum.
“I would stay and fan you myself, but I have
to call on the sick animals. I don’t know who
can fan you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, please let me!” cried a voice at the window,
and in flew the butterfly, whose broken
wing was all well now. “I was coming over to
thank Uncle Wiggily,” she said, “and I heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
what you said. I would just love to perch on his
pillow and fan him with my wings.”</p>

<p>“The very thing!” cried Dr. Possum. So the
butterfly lady perched herself on Uncle Wiggily’s
pillow, and with her beautiful wings fluttering
up and down, she fanned him, making a
lovely cool breeze, so that he soon fell asleep.
And with the gentle fanning, and because of Dr.
Possum’s medicine, the rabbit gentleman was
soon all well again.</p>

<p>So that shows you should always help a butterfly
when you can, as you never can tell when
a butterfly might help you.</p>

<p>And that’s all I can tell you to-night, but on
the next page, if the garden rake doesn’t jump
over the fence and play tag with the rose bush and
get all scratched, I’ll tell you about Uncle Wiggily
and the sawdust.</p>

<span class="fs70">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE SAWDUST</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“You’re off again, I see,” spoke Nurse Jane
Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper,
one day, to Uncle Wiggily Longears, the rabbit
gentleman, for whom she kept house.</p>

<p>“Yes, I thought I would go out for a little
ride,” answered Mr. Longears, as he blew some
heated air into the toy circus balloons of his airship.
“It is a lovely day, and perhaps I may
meet with an adventure; who knows?”</p>

<p>“True enough, who knows?” agreed Nurse
Jane. “Well, I hope if you do have an adventure
it will be a pleasant one.”</p>

<p>An adventure, you know, children, is something
that happens to you, like falling down
stairs. That’s an unpleasant adventure. Finding
a penny rolling up hill is a pleasant adventure.
That’s the difference, you see.</p>

<p>So Uncle Wiggily started off in his airship,
which was made from one of Miss Fuzzy
Wuzzy’s old clothes baskets, some toy circus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
balloons, a Japanese umbrella and an electric
fan.</p>

<p>The old gentleman rabbit had not ridden so
very far, sailing above the tree tops, as he was,
before, all of a sudden, he heard a sad little voice
crying:</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! Oh, isn’t that too bad? Oh, my
poor Cora Ann Multiplicationtable!”</p>

<p>“Ha! Some one in trouble!” exclaimed
Uncle Wiggily, looking down. “I must see if I
cannot help them.”</p>

<p>Then he saw Susie Littletail, the rabbit girl,
sitting on a stump, and looking at something in
her paws.</p>

<p>“It must be her doll,” thought Uncle Wiggily
“For the doll’s name is Cora Ann Multiplicationtable.
I’ll go down and see what is the
trouble.”</p>

<p>Down he went, and he found poor Susie crying
sadly.</p>

<p>“What has happened?” asked Uncle Wiggily,
kindly.</p>

<p>“Oh, all the sawdust stuffing has run out of
my doll,” said the little rabbit girl. “I was
carrying her out to get the air, for she has been
ill, and all of a sudden, one of her legs caught in
a thorn bush, ripping a hole in the cloth. Out
ran the sawdust before I could stop it. Look!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
And Poor Susie held up Cora Ann Multiplicationtable.
The doll was as limp and slimpsy as
a sheet of blotting paper after it has fallen into
the ink well.</p>

<p>“Oh, that is too bad,” said Uncle Wiggily,
“but perhaps I can help you. I’ll try.”</p>

<p>“Can you make her well again?” asked Susie,
hopefully.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I think so,” answered the rabbit
gentleman. “I will get some more sawdust, and
stuff her with it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, joy!” cried Susie, clapping her paws.
“Then I will be happy again, for I love my doll
Cora Ann Multiplicationtable very much. I
hope you can cure her.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll go get the sawdust and try,” said
Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>Into his airship he jumped, and up above the
tree tops he went, to sail about, looking for sawdust.
He peered all around, Uncle Wiggily
did, but he saw no sawdust. Sawdust, you know,
is little, fine grains of wood, made when the carpenter
saws a board in two pieces to mend the
fence.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I can’t find any sawdust up
here,” said the rabbit gentleman, “after a while
I’ll have to go down to the earth again.”</p>

<p>Down he went, and, though he looked all over,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
he could find no sawdust. He thought perhaps
he might meet a wagon-load of it, going to the
butcher shop, for butchers put sawdust on their
store floors instead of carpet. But no wagon-loads
of sawdust were to be seen.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. “No
sawdust down here, and none up in the air. I
wonder where I can find any for Susie’s doll? I
know, I’ll take a little trip down to the seashore
in my airship. If I can’t find any sawdust there,
perhaps I can bring back some seashore sand with
which to stuff Susie’s doll. Yes, that’s what I’ll
do.”</p>

<p>Up above the tree tops the rabbit gentleman
went again in his airship, and soon he was at the
seashore.</p>

<p>Up and down the beach he hopped, looking
for sawdust, but he could see none. If there had
ever been any the wind must have blown it away
long ago.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” cried Uncle Wiggily. “This is
too bad! I guess I’ll have to take back the sand
after all.”</p>

<p>“Why, what is the trouble, if I may ask?”
inquired a voice out in the salty sea waves, and
Uncle Wiggily looked and saw the queerest fish
he had ever beheld. It had a very long nose, and
sticking out on either side of this nose were sharp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
teeth. But Uncle Wiggily was not frightened.</p>

<p>“What is the trouble?” the fish asked again.</p>

<p>“Why, I want some sawdust for Susie’s doll,
Cora Ann Multiplicationtable,” answered the
rabbit gentleman, “but I can find none.”</p>

<p>“Ha! Say no more!” cried the queer fish very
politely. “Sawdust! I will give you all the
sawdust you want. Just wait a minute.”</p>

<p>“Ha! How can you give me sawdust, if I
may be so bold as to ask?” cried Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>“Why, I am a sawfish,” was the reply. “I
can saw sawdust.” Then the fish gave a flop of
his tail and out on the beach he jumped. He soon
found a big log that had been washed up by the
waves, and then, with his long nose covered with
teeth, which were just like those of a saw, the
fish sawed back and forth on the log with his
nose, and made a lot of sawdust for Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>The rabbit gentleman caught the sawdust in
his tall silk hat, and then thanking the sawfish,
who jumped back into the ocean to wash his face,
Uncle Wiggily hurried off in his airship to take
the sawdust to Susie for her doll.</p>

<p>“Oh, how kind you are!” cried the little rabbit
girl.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="p112" style="max-width: 38.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p112.jpg" alt="Uncle Wiggily with cat">
</figure>

<p>“Pray do not mention it,” politely said Uncle
Wiggily, as he helped stuff the sawdust into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>Cora Ann Multiplicationtable. Soon she was as
plump and fat as ever. So you see a sawfish is
of some use in this world, after all.</p>

<p>And on the page after this, if the little dog’s
collar doesn’t go to the laundry and get all wet
in the bluing water, I’ll tell you about Uncle
Wiggily and the dusty carpet.</p>

</div>

<p>“Be careful, please! Look out! Kindly wipe
your feet!” cried Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the
muskrat lady housekeeper, as Uncle Wiggily
Longears, the rabbit gentleman, was going into
his hollow stump bungalow one day, after he had
been out riding in his airship.</p>

<p>“Why, what is the matter?” asked Uncle
Wiggily. “Don’t I always wipe my feet, Nurse
Jane?” and this time the rabbit gentleman was
very particular to give them an extra polish, or
two, on the door-mat before entering.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! as a rule you are very good that
way,” said Nurse Jane politely, as she looked at
her tail to see if Sammie Littletail, the boy rabbit,
had tied any knots in it for a joke. But he
had not, I am glad to say.</p>

<p>“Yes, as a rule, you are very careful,” went on
Nurse Jane, “but you see I am house cleaning,
and I have just scrubbed the floors, and so I
don’t want a speck of dirt on them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, ha! I see! House cleaning!” exclaimed
Uncle Wiggily. “Well, I suppose it has to be
done once in a while, but I do not like it at all. I
think I will go to my room and read, and
when supper is ready, call me, please.”</p>

<p>“I will,” promised Nurse Jane, and then she
went on looking for moth-millers, which eat up
your clothes, and she hunted for dust in all the
corners, Nurse Jane did, and she swept and
cleaned, and she had a great old time, she did!</p>

<p>“My, this is awful!” exclaimed Uncle Wiggily,
as he went inside the hollow stump bungalow.
“Why, there is hardly room to move!”</p>

<p>And well might he say so, for the chairs and
tables were all scattered about, the carpets and
rugs were piled in the middle of the floor, and
the whole place seemed very much upset, indeed.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose it’s always this way when
house cleaning has to be done,” thought Uncle
Wiggily, with a sigh. “I must put up with it.”</p>

<p>Then he stumbled over a stool, tripped on a
chair, fell over a roll of carpet, and finally he
reached his room, and sat down to read a book
about how to make yellow carrots turn pink by
coloring them with Easter eggs.</p>

<p>By and by after a while, Uncle Wiggily began
to feel hungry.</p>

<p>“I wish I had something to eat,” he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
looking in the book at a large picture of a red,
white and blue turnip, with a pink ribbon tied on
it. “I wonder if supper is not nearly ready?”</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily went to the door of his room
and listened. He wanted to see if he could hear,
down in the kitchen, the rattle of dishes and the
clatter of the knives and forks. That would
show Nurse Jane was setting the table, and
when she set the table it was, nearly always, meal
time.</p>

<p>But Uncle Wiggily could hear nothing but the
moving and scraping of chairs about on the floor,
and the flip-flop of the dusting cloth as Nurse
Jane snapped it here and there, knocking the
dust off the furniture upon the carpet, so she
could not see it so plainly.</p>

<p>“Ha! Hum!” murmured Uncle Wiggily.
“That doesn’t sound much like supper. I shall
have to wait a bit longer.”</p>

<p>So he waited and waited, but there came no
welcome sound of the rattle of dishes, nor the
clatter of knives and forks. Nor was there any
nice smell of ice cream frying on the stove, nor
of peanuts boiling in the tea kettle. Nothing like
supper at all.</p>

<p>“Well, this is very strange!” exclaimed Uncle
Wiggily, as he got up from his chair about the
forty-’leventh time to listen if supper were ready.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
“Something must have happened to Nurse Jane.
I’ll go look,” he said.</p>

<p>Putting aside his book, down stairs the rabbit
gentleman went, and he saw the muskrat lady in
the yard, stretching a dusty carpet out on the
green grass.</p>

<p>“Ahem! Pray pardon and excuse me, Nurse
Jane,” said Uncle Wiggily, “but may I ask
when tea will be ready?” You see he said tea
to be more polite like.</p>

<p>“Tea!” exclaimed Nurse Jane. “Why, I can
not give you your supper, Wiggy, until I have
beaten all the dust out of this dusty carpet. And
it will take me some time, Wiggy.” You see she
called him Wiggy for short, because she was very
busy at house cleaning.</p>

<p>“No supper until that carpet is beaten?”
cried Uncle Wiggily, sad and disappointed like.</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” answered Nurse Jane. Then,
with her long tail, which was like a carpet beater
stick, the muskrat lady began to whip the dust
out of the dusty carpet to make it clean.</p>

<p>“Oh, my! That is going to take a long time!”
thought the rabbit gentleman. “I shall be very
hungry indeed before I get any supper this
evening, if I can’t get it until that carpet is
beaten.”</p>

<p>So he waited and waited, and Nurse Jane kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
on beating the dusty carpet with her long tail,
and Uncle Wiggily was getting more and more
hungry, when, all of a sudden, he heard some
voices shouting:</p>

<p>“That’s the way to run! Throw the ball!
Slide to home base! Put him out! Over the
fence! Hurray! A home run!”</p>

<p>“Ha! Animal boys playing ball!” cried
Uncle Wiggily. “I have an idea! I’ll give them
five cents each, and get them to beat the dusty
carpet with the baseball bats! Then Nurse
Jane will not have to do it and can get supper
for me!”</p>

<p>Out he went to the vacant lot where the animal
boys were playing ball. Charlie, the chicken
chap, was at the bat.</p>

<p>“Boys, will you beat a dusty carpet for Nurse
Jane?” asked Uncle Wiggily. “I would do it
myself, only my rheumatism is so bad that I
can’t!”</p>

<p>“Surely, we will beat it!” cried Jimmie
Wibblewobble, the duck. So the animal boys
soon beat the dusty carpet with their baseball
bats, and Uncle Wiggily gave them five cents
each for ice cream cones.</p>

<p>And, shortly after that, Nurse Jane made
ready the rabbit gentleman’s supper, and everybody
was happy, and when the carpet was no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
longer dusty, house cleaning time was over, and
Uncle Wiggily could live in peace and quietness
and he was glad.</p>

<p>And that’s the end of this story, but if the ivy
vine doesn’t climb up in my window and pull the
clothes off the rubber doll’s bed I’ll tell you next
about Uncle Wiggily and the little lamb.</p>

<span class="fs70">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE LITTLE LAMB</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Uncle Wiggily, the old gentleman rabbit,
was out in the yard of his hollow stump bungalow
one morning, putting a new hair ribbon on his
airship, so that it might flutter in the wind and
look pretty. All of a sudden Nurse Jane Fuzzy
Wuzzy, the nice muskrat lady housekeeper,
called to him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily, would you mind going
to the store for me?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” answered the rabbit gentleman
politely. “What is it you wish?” And he took
off his tall silk hat and bowed.</p>

<p>“I need a loaf of bread, some sugar and a
bottle of milk,” answered the muskrat lady.</p>

<p>“Say no more!” Uncle Wiggily exclaimed,
with another polite bow. “You shall have them
at once. I will go to the store right away in my
airship.”</p>

<p>“Here is the money,” went on Nurse Jane.
“Be careful not to lose it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll try,” answered Uncle Wiggily with a
laugh.</p>

<p>Off he started for the store, sailing above the
tops of the trees in his airship, which was made
from one of Nurse Jane’s old clothes baskets,
some toy circus balloons to lift it in the air, a
Japanese umbrella to keep off the rain, and an
electric fan, that went around whizzie-izzie. The
electric fan pushed the airship along through the
air, you see.</p>

<p>Well, Uncle Wiggily had not gone very far
before, all of a sudden, something happened to
his airship. The electric fan became all twisted
up in the balloons, and the sofa cushions, which
were in the clothes basket, to make a soft place
for Uncle Wiggily to fall out on, in case of accidents—these
sofa cushions began turning somersaults,
and the first thing the rabbit gentleman
knew he himself, was falling down.</p>

<p>Down and down he went, faster and faster.
The sofa cushions toppled out of the basket, by
themselves, and Uncle Wiggily said:</p>

<p>“Well, I think I myself am to be bumped
very hard this time!”</p>

<p>But he was not. Just then, down below on
the ground, there came along a wagon with a lot
of sheep’s fleeces in it. Sheep’s fleeces are wool,
you know. Men cut the wool, or the long, fluffy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
hair, off the backs of sheep, and it is woven into
cloth and made into clothes. It does not hurt the
sheep to cut off the wool, any more than it hurts
to cut your hair.</p>

<p>So Uncle Wiggily fell out of his airship on
top of this load of wool, which was not yet woven
into cloth, and he was not hurt a bit, for he
bounced up and down (like the circus man in the
net) on the fluffy wool.</p>

<p>“Ha! That was very kind of you to come
along just when you did to catch me as I fell,”
said Uncle Wiggily to the man who drove the
wool wagon.</p>

<p>“Oh, do not thank me,” spoke the man.
“Thank those sheep over there. The wool was
sheared off their backs, and when the nicest sheep
lady of them all saw you falling just now she told
me to drive over here quickly as I could so that
I might be ready for you to fall on.”</p>

<p>“Ah, then it is you I have to thank,” said
Uncle Wiggily to the sheep, with a low, polite
bow. “You have done me a great favor. Perhaps,
some day, I may be able to do you one.”</p>

<p>“Pray do not mention it,” said the sheep,
also politely.</p>

<p>Then Uncle Wiggily mended his airship, sailed
on to the store in it, and bought the things Nurse
Jane wanted. On his way home, as he was flying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
over a green field, he heard a sad voice down below
crying:</p>

<p>“Oh, my little lamb is lost! Oh, where can he
be! Oh, isn’t this too bad!”</p>

<p>“Ha! That is my friend, the sheep lady, on
whose wool I fell,” said Uncle Wiggily. “Now
is my chance to do her a favor.”</p>

<p>Down he went in his airship, and he asked:</p>

<p>“What has happened, Mrs. Sheep? You
seem to be in trouble.”</p>

<p>“I am in trouble,” sadly answered the mamma
sheep. “My little lamb baby has strayed away,
and is lost, I fear. Oh, I am so sorry!”</p>

<p>“Never fear!” said Uncle Wiggily, bravely.
“I will go look for your little lost lamb in my
airship. You were kind to me, and I am only
too glad to be kind to you.”</p>

<p>“That is very good of you,” said the mamma
sheep.</p>

<p>Up in the air went Uncle Wiggily. He sailed
around and around, looking down on the ground
for the little lost lamb, but all the rabbit gentleman
could see were trees, woods and green fields.</p>

<p>“I wonder if I can ever find that little lost
lamb for the mamma sheep whose wool saved me
from a bad fall?” thought Uncle Wiggily. “I
must try my best.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>So he looked and he looked again, and, all of
a sudden, he heard a little voice crying:</p>

<p>“Baa! Baa! Baa!”</p>

<p>“Ha! There is the little lost lamb crying for
its mamma,” said Uncle Wiggily. He looked
down over the side of his clothes basket airship,
and there, on the earth below, he saw the little
lamb, caught fast in a prickly briar bush. The
thorns and stickers of the bush had become entangled
in the lamb’s wool, and it could not get
loose, no matter how it tried.</p>

<p>“Baa! Baa! Baa! I shall never see my
mamma again!” cried the poor little lamb, who
had wandered away and become lost in the
bushes. “Oh, where is my mamma?”</p>

<p>“Ha! I will take you to her!” exclaimed
Uncle Wiggily. Down, again, he went in his airship,
and, with a pair of scissors he had in his
pocket, Uncle Wiggily soon cut off the briars
from the bramble bush so he could loosen the little
lamb. Then, in his paws, Uncle Wiggily carried
the lamb to the airship, and put it on the soft sofa
cushions.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so hungry!” bleated the little lamb.</p>

<p>“And I have just the things for you to eat!”
cried Uncle Wiggily. Then he gave the little
lamb some of the bread, milk and sugar, he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
bought at the store, and soon they were at the
field where the lamb lived with its mamma.</p>

<p>And, Oh! how glad the mamma sheep was to
see her lamb again! She thanked Uncle Wiggily
again and again, and Uncle Wiggily blushed behind
his ears, he was so bashful-like. So you see
it is sometimes a good thing to fall out of an airship
upon a load of wool.</p>

<p>And very soon, if the trolley car doesn’t slip
off the track, and run over the wax doll’s rubber
ball, I’ll tell you about Uncle Wiggily and the
soap bubbles.</p>

<span class="fs70">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE SOAP BUBBLES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Well, do you think anything will happen
to you this morning?” asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy
Wuzzy, the muskrat lady, of Uncle Wiggily
Longears, the rabbit gentleman, as she saw him
starting off for a ride in his airship one day.</p>

<p>“You never can tell,” he answered. “I may
have the most wonderful adventure, and again I
may just sail around, and come back again, with
nothing more than a yeast cake.”</p>

<p>“Speaking of yeast cakes, one would be very
good for you to carry along with you in your
airship,” said Nurse Jane.</p>

<p>“Why?” Uncle Wiggily wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Because yeast makes the bread rise, and it
might make your airship rise, in case your circus
balloons were to burst, and let you down,” the
muskrat lady replied.</p>

<p>“I am very glad you mentioned it,” said
Uncle Wiggily, making his most polite bow. “I
shall get a yeast cake the very first chance I
have.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>Then he went out sailing in his airship, but he
had not gone very far above the tree tops before
he heard, down below him, a voice saying:</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! I wish I had something to do!”</p>

<p>“Ha! Somebody else in trouble!” exclaimed
Uncle Wiggily. “I must go down and see if I
cannot help them.”</p>

<p>So down he went in his airship, and whom do
you suppose it was he found? Why, Arabella,
the little chicken girl, was sitting on the doorstep
of the hencoop, crying as hard as she could
cry.</p>

<p>“Oh, what is the matter?” asked Uncle Wiggily
kindly.</p>

<p>“I have no one to play with!” sobbed Arabella.
“You see I am just getting over the
mumps, and none of the other animal children,
who have not had the mumps, want to play with
me. And nobody but I has had the mumps!” she
sobbed.</p>

<p>“That is too bad!” said Uncle Wiggily,
kindly. “But perhaps I can make up a little
fun for you. Do you like to blow soap bubbles?”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed I do!” cried Arabella, making
her wing feathers wiggle. “I just love to do it!
But I have no soap suds, and no pipe with which
to blow the bubbles.”</p>

<p>“Say no more!” cried Uncle Wiggily in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
jolly voice. “I will get everything you need.”</p>

<p>Off he went in his airship to the soap bubble
store. There he bought a pipe, and a nice cake
of scented soap, that smelled like a barber shop.
Coming back to where Arabella still sat, all alone
on the doorstep of the chicken coop, Uncle Wiggily
made her a nice bowl full of soapy suds.</p>

<p>“Now you may blow some nice bubbles,
Arabella,” spoke the rabbit gentleman. “I will
watch you for a while, and then I will ride along
in my airship, and look for an adventure.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you afraid of catching my mumps?”
asked Arabella with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Oh, bless your hair ribbon! I’ve had ’em!”
cried the old rabbit gentleman, jolly like.</p>

<p>Then he watched Arabella blow the bubbles.
And what large ones the little chicken girl blew
from the bowl of the pipe! The bubbles were red,
and green and blue and yellow and purple in
color. They floated up in the air like balloons.</p>

<p>“My, you are certainly a fine bubble-blower!”
exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. “But I must go
now.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, for making some fun for me,”
spoke Arabella most politely.</p>

<p>Then she blew bubbles by herself, as Uncle
Wiggily sailed away in his airship. He had not
gone very far before, all of a sudden, out of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
tree flew a bad wasp, with a stinger in the end of
his tail. Oh, this wasp-bee was very angry! I
think perhaps he had had no honey that day, for
his breakfast.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, by flying over my tree?”
asked the wasp of Uncle Wiggily, saucy like.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” spoke the rabbit gentleman,
“but I did not harm your tree, just sailing over
it in my airship.”</p>

<p>“Yes you did!” buzzed the wasp. “You
made the leaves flutter with your electric fan.
Now I am going to sting your balloons.”</p>

<p>And, before Uncle Wiggily could stop her,
that bad wasp flew up, and stung a hole in every
one of the toy circus balloons that floated on top
of the rabbit gentleman’s airship.</p>

<p>“Oh, I must get away from here!” cried
Uncle Wiggily, and, making his airship go as
fast as he could, the rabbit gentleman was soon
far away from the bad wasp.</p>

<p>But alas! Likewise unhappiness. The balloons
were filled with holes, from the sting of the
wasp, and all the air began leaking out of them.
The airship began to fall, having nothing to hold
it up.</p>

<p>“Oh, my!” cried Uncle Wiggily. “Here I
go again!”</p>

<p>And down to the ground he came, only the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
sofa cushions in the clothes basket made a soft
place for him on which to fall, and so he was not
hurt.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” Uncle Wiggily exclaimed. “My
airship is spoiled!” He tried to make it go up
again, but, of course, it would not, with the balloons
all burst as they were, so they could not
hold air.</p>

<p>“What am I to do?” asked Uncle Wiggily.
“I should have brought along a yeast cake, as
Nurse Jane told me to do, and then I could rise.
Alas, now I cannot go up like a loaf of bread.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes you can, Uncle Wiggily!” exclaimed
a voice near him, and there stood Arabella, the
chicken girl, with her pipe, and bowl of soap
suds for blowing bubbles.</p>

<p>“How can I go up when the balloons are
burst?” asked the rabbit gentleman.</p>

<p>“With my soap bubbles!” cackled Arabella.
“Soap bubbles are very light, and will rise in
the air just like balloons. I will blow you a lot
of bubbles, you can fasten them to your airship,
and up you will go.” Then she blew forty-’leven
bubbles, or maybe more, for all I know. Uncle
Wiggily caught them, and fastened them with
silk threads, and cobwebs, which a kind spider
lady spun for him, to his clothes basket airship,
just as the toy circus balloons had been fastened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>And the bubbles were so light, and went up
in the air so nicely, that they took the airship and
Uncle Wiggily up with them. The old gentleman
rabbit just had time to thank Arabella for
blowing the soap bubbles for him, and then he
was far above the trees, sailing away.</p>

<p>“Arabella was certainly a smart chicken girl
to think of raising my airship with soap bubbles!”
cried Uncle Wiggily, and then later on he
stopped in the drug store, and had a quart of
strawberry ice cream sent to the hencoop for the
little chicken girl, and the old rabbit gentleman
took another quart home for Nurse Jane Fuzzy
Wuzzy. So you see, sometimes it is a good thing
to have a wasp sting toy circus balloons on an
airship.</p>

<p>And, on the page after this, if the vegetable
man doesn’t put an orange on our clothes post,
for the pussy cat to play tag with, I’ll tell you
about Uncle Wiggily and the cake of ice.</p>

<span class="fs70">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE CAKE OF ICE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“My goodness me sakes alive and a bushel of
apple sauce!” exclaimed Nurse Jane Fuzzy
Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper, one evening.
She had come out on the front porch of the
hollow stump bungalow and was fanning herself
with a cabbage leaf, left over from Uncle Wiggily’s
supper.</p>

<p>“Why, what in the world is the matter, Miss
Fuzzy Wuzzy?” asked the old rabbit gentleman,
as he looked up at the tip of his ear to see if a
mosquito was sitting there in a rocking chair.
But none was, I am glad to say. “What is the
matter, Nurse Jane?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Matter!” cried the muskrat lady, “it is so
very hot! That is what’s the matter. And it will
be warmer to-morrow!”</p>

<p>“How can you tell?” Uncle Wiggily wanted
to know. “To-morrow is not here yet, and when
it comes it will be to-day instead of to-morrow.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="p132" style="max-width: 39.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p132.jpg" alt="Uncle Wiggily flying away">
</figure>

<p>“I suppose that is one of your jokes,” spoke
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>Nurse Jane, as she tied her tail in two knots and
part of another one, so she would not step on it
when she danced the corn meal flop, which she
and Uncle Wiggily did every evening. “Another
joke, eh, Wiggy, about to-morrow never
coming?” repeated Nurse Jane.</p>

<p>“Oh, I will have my joke once in a while,”
chuckled the rabbit gentleman. “But what
makes you think it is going to be so warm?” and
Uncle Wiggily took a drink of boiled ice cream
cone soda water, so he would not catch cold.</p>

<p>“I can tell it is going to be warm because the
sunset is so red and fiery,” answered Nurse Jane,
as she looked over toward the West, where the
sun was going to bed.</p>

<p>“Well, tell Mr. Whitewash, the polar bear
gentleman, to leave us an extra large piece of ice
to-morrow, if it going to be so hot,” said Uncle
Wiggily. Then he went over to call on Grandfather
Goosey Gander, the goose gentleman, who
was out raking up his corn meal garden, so he
could have pancakes for breakfast.</p>

<p>The next day was indeed very hot. Nurse
Jane arose very early, and the first thing she did
was to put out, on the front porch of the hollow
stump bungalow, a card which had printed on it,
in large letters, the word:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p class="center no-indent fs120">ICE.</p>

<p>“There!” exclaimed Nurse Jane, as she gave
the rose geranium flower a drink of buttermilk,
“Mr. Whitewash, the polar bear gentleman, will
see that sign and bring us a nice large cake of
ice.”</p>

<p>But nothing ever turns out, in this world, the
way you think it is going to. At least it never
does for me. Many a time I have made up my
mind, in the morning, that in the evening I would
go to a moving picture show. But, when evening
came, time and time again, I have had to go to a
baseball game. Still one cannot help it. I only
mention that to show that you never can tell what
will happen.</p>

<p>Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy could not, either.
When she put out the ice sign she certainly
thought Mr. Whitewash would bring in a nice,
large cake. But he did not. In fact, Mr. Whitewash
did not even see the sign.</p>

<p>What happened was this: Soon after Nurse
Jane put out the cardboard notice, along came
Billie Bushytail, the boy squirrel, and his brother
Johnnie.</p>

<p>“Oh, Johnnie,” cried Billie, pointing with his
paw. “There’s a fine piece of cardboard to make
a lemonade sign for us. We can write on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
back of it, ‘LEMONADE: FIVE CENTS
A GLASS,’ and put it up over our stand.”</p>

<p>“So we can!” exclaimed Billie. Then the
squirrel boys, not meaning to do anything wrong,
you understand, took down the ice sign Nurse
Jane had hung out on Uncle Wiggily’s porch.
And those squirrel boys made another sign on the
back of the piece of pasteboard, advertising their
lemonade sale, which they held on their lawn. I’ll
tell you about that in another story.</p>

<p>Well, it got warmer and warmer, and it was
nearly noon. The small piece of ice in Nurse
Jane’s refrigerator had melted and she needed
more.</p>

<p>“I wonder what has happened to Mr. Whitewash,
the Polar bear?” she remarked. “He
hasn’t come yet.” She went out to look down
the street, and she saw Mrs. Wibblewobble, the
duck lady, on her porch.</p>

<p>“Has the Polar ice bear been past yet?” asked
Nurse Jane.</p>

<p>“Long ago,” answered Mrs. Wibblewobble.
Then Nurse Jane saw that her sign was gone, and
though she did not know who had taken it, she
knew the ice bear had not seen it, and that was
the reason he brought in no ice. When he saw
no sign he supposed his animal customers wanted
no ice, and drove on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” cried Nurse Jane. “No ice, and
it is very hot. It is hotter even than I thought it
would be. My butter will melt and the milk will
sour. Oh, what shall I do?”</p>

<p>“Hush! Calm yourself, my dear! Have no
fear!” exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. “I will go
down in my airship to the factory where Mr.
Whitewash, the Polar bear gentleman, makes his
ice, and bring a cake home for you.”</p>

<p>“That will be lovely!” cried Nurse Jane, fanning
herself with the coal shovel, she was so excited-like.</p>

<p>It did not take Uncle Wiggily long to go after
the cake of ice, as his airship went very fast.
Soon he was on his way back to the hollow stump
with it, flying very swiftly, and thinking how
nice it would be to have a glass of ice water.</p>

<p>But, as he rode along over the tree-tops, down
below he heard voices crying:</p>

<p>“Why, it’s raining! It’s raining hard!” A
number of the animal people were running in the
house after their umbrellas.</p>

<p>“Raining!” cried Uncle Wiggily. “It isn’t
raining, or I’d feel the drops. Besides, there
isn’t a cloud in the sky!”</p>

<p>“The rain is coming from your airship!” cried
Sammie Littletail, the boy rabbit who stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
down below on the ground. “The water is dropping
from your airship.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it is the cake of ice! The ice is melting
and running through the holes in the clothes
basket,” spoke Uncle Wiggily. And, surely
enough, the cake of ice had melted and the water
of it fell from the airship and made every one
think it was raining. And when Uncle Wiggily
reached the hollow stump, there was not a bit of
ice left—it had all melted.</p>

<p>But, as it happened, Mr. Whitewash, the Polar
bear gentleman, came past on his return trip and
in his wagon, where it could not melt, he had a
big cake of ice. This he gave to Nurse Jane, for
her refrigerator and all was well. Everybody
was happy, and Uncle Wiggily said the next time
he went after a cake of ice he would wrap it up in
a blanket so it would not melt and make his
friends believe it was raining, when it was not.</p>

<p>So that shows you a hot day is of some use after
all, and on the page after this if the lemonade
pitcher doesn’t go to the ink well for a glass of
jelly, I’ll tell you about Uncle Wiggily and
Charlie Chick.</p>

<span class="fs70">UNCLE WIGGILY AND CHARLIE CHICK</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Well, what are you doing, Charlie, my
boy?” asked Uncle Wiggily Longears, the rabbit
gentleman, of the little chicken chap, one day, as
he saw Charlie on the shores of the duck pond
with some boards, a hammer, a saw, some nails,
a fishpole and part of a bed sheet. “What are
you making, Charlie?”</p>

<p>“I am going to make a sailboat and go sailing
across the duck pond,” replied Charlie, as he
ruffled up his tail feathers and made a polite bow.
Chicken boys always ruffle up their tail feathers
when they bow. It’s a way they’ve been taught
at school, so Charlie did just right, you see.</p>

<p>“A sailboat, eh?” exclaimed Uncle Wiggily.
“Well, I hope you have a nice sail on the duck
pond.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Uncle Wiggily. Don’t you
want to come with me?” asked Charlie still more
politely as he gave a little crow. Whenever a
chicken chap gives you an invitation to go anywhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
with him, he always crows. They are
brought up that way, so Charlie did the right act
again, you see.</p>

<p>“Sail with you? No, I thank you, Charlie,”
replied Uncle Wiggily. “You see, I am on my
way in my airship to go to the store for Nurse
Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy. She wants some oranges to
put in the potato cakes for supper. Some other
time I will sail with you.”</p>

<p>And the old rabbit gentleman, who really was
out for a sail in his airship, started off again for
the store. He had been sailing overhead, but,
when he saw Charlie on the shore of the duck
pond, Uncle Wiggily came down to see what
the chicken boy was doing.</p>

<p>“Well, now if I hoist my sail on the fishpole I
think my boat will be finished, and I can cross the
duck pond,” said Charlie to himself, after a bit.
He had hammered and sawed and pounded, nailing
together board and stick, until really he had
made quite a nice chicken boat.</p>

<p>So, while Uncle Wiggily was on the way to
the store in his airship, Charlie started to sail
across the duck pond, which was very large just
then, as so much water had rained in it.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is great!” Charlie crowed, as the
wind blew on his sail and pushed the boat
along through the water. “I only wish I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
some of my friends aboard to enjoy it with me.”</p>

<p>Charlie was always that way—not a bit selfish.</p>

<p>So he sailed and he sailed, back and forth
across the pond, and, now and then, he looked
up to the sky to see if he could see any signs of
Uncle Wiggily coming back. But he saw nothing
of the rabbit gentleman in his airship.</p>

<p>But the wind, which had been blowing more
and more gently, suddenly stopped altogether,
and there Charlie’s boat was, becalmed out in the
middle of the duck pond, far from shore.</p>

<p>“Oh ho!” cried Charlie. “This is not very
pleasant. I wonder how I am going to get to
shore?”</p>

<p>He looked all about him, but he could see no
way of getting to dry land unless the wind should
blow him. For Charlie had in his boat no oars,
so he could not row. He had no pole with which
to push, though he might have taken down the
fishpole on which was fastened his sail. But he
did not want to do this.</p>

<p>“And the duck pond is too deep for me to
wade,” said Charlie to himself, “and I cannot
swim. Now, if I were only a duck, I would be
all right. I could then jump off and swim. But,
as it is, I must stay here until the wind comes
again, to blow on my sail and send me to shore.”</p>

<p>So Charlie waited, and it was not much fun.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
It grew late, and soon, he knew, it would be
supper time. Still he was out in the middle of
the duck pond, far from shore.</p>

<p>“Help! Help!” crowed Charlie. “Will no
one help me get to land in my boat?”</p>

<p>No one answered him. If Lulu or Alice or
Jimmie Wibblewobble, the duck children, had
been near there I am sure they would have helped
Charlie. But all the ducks were away that day,
having gone to a Mother Goose party. So no
one heard Charlie call.</p>

<p>“Oh, if there was only some wind!” cried the
chicken boy. “I think I shall whistle for a
breeze, as I have read of sailors doing when they
want their boats to go.”</p>

<p>So Charlie whistled all the tunes he could think
of, such as: “Please Don’t Tip the Milk Can
Over,” and “Who Put Soap in Dollie’s Eye?”</p>

<p>But, no matter how much the chicken boy
whistled, no breeze came to blow against his sail
and waft him to shore.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I will have to blow my own
wind,” said Charlie, after a bit. “That may
help.” So he puffed up his chest, and through
his bill he blew a strong blast on the sail. But it
did no good, any more than it would do you good
if you took hold of your shoe laces and tried to
raise yourself up off the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” cried Charlie. “I guess I’ll have
to stay here all night, and I want to be home for
supper, because they’re going to have corn meal
shortcake. Oh will no one help me?”</p>

<p>But no one came near the duck pond and no
wind blew, and the boat was still out in the middle
of the water. It did look as though Charlie
would be out all night, as he once was with the
wild turkey.</p>

<p>“Oh, will no one help me?” cried Charlie, for
the last time.</p>

<p>“Yes, I will!” shouted a voice up in the air,
and Charlie, who was just going to put his head
under his wing and go to sleep, roused up and
crowed:</p>

<p>“Oh, are you going to help me? Who are
you?”</p>

<p>“Uncle Wiggily Longears, in his airship!”
was the answer. “I see what is the trouble.
You have no wind for your sailboat. Here, catch
that!” And, hovering up in the air over the
chicken boy’s boat, the rabbit gentleman dropped
down a clothes line he had bought in the store for
Nurse Jane. “Hold fast to that, Charlie!” cried
Uncle Wiggily. “I’ll keep hold of my end and
I’ll soon pull you to shore with my airship.”</p>

<p>Charlie held the rope tightly in his claw, and
off started Uncle Wiggily in the airship, towing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
the chicken boat along over the duck pond. Soon
he was safe on shore and, after thanking the rabbit
gentleman; Charlie said:</p>

<p>“The next time I go sailing I am going to
take a balloon full of wind along with me to blow
my sail. Then I will be all right.”</p>

<p>So this shows you a clothes line is good for
something, after all, and on the page after this,
if our window shade doesn’t roll up so fast that
it jumps through the dish pan, like a circus lady
off an elephant’s back, I’ll tell you about Uncle
Wiggily and Lulu Wibblewobble.</p>

<span class="fs70">UNCLE WIGGILY AND LULU WIBBLEWOBBLE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“My goodness me sakes alive, and some peanut
pancakes!” cried Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy,
the muskrat lady, as she saw Uncle Wiggily, the
rabbit gentleman, out in the yard one day punching
some sofa cushions. “What in the world are
you doing, Wiggy?” asked Nurse Jane.</p>

<p>“Well,” replied the old gentleman rabbit for
whom the muskrat lady kept house, “I am trying
to make these sofa cushions softer, if you please,
Nurse Jane.”</p>

<p>“Softer? What for?” she asked.</p>

<p>“So they will be easier for me to fall on, in
case I have any accidents when out riding in my
airship,” replied Uncle Wiggily. “You see, I
am sort of shaking up the feathers inside the
cushions, by punching them with my paws. Not
to hurt them! No, indeed, not for the world
would I hurt the feathers,” cried the rabbit
gentleman.</p>

<p>“So that’s why you are punching the cushions?”
asked Nurse Jane, as she folded her long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
tail around her neck to keep the mosquitoes from
biting her. “Well, all I have to say is, Wiggy,
that you never will make your cushions soft that
way.”</p>

<p>“No?” asked Uncle Wiggily, sort of surprised
like.</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” answered Nurse Jane. “The
trouble is that you need more feathers in the
cushions. That will make them nice and soft for
you to fall on in case your airship turns a somersault.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried the old rabbit gentleman. “I
am glad you mentioned it. I will take a ride over
to the Wibblewobble duck penhouse at once, and
have Mrs. Wibblewobble put more feathers in
the cushions. That will make them lovely and
soft. Queer, isn’t it, that I should have thought
punching the pillows was the proper thing to do—very
queer, wasn’t it, Nurse Jane?”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you are often queer, Wiggy,” she
said, calling him that for short. “Once more
doesn’t make much difference.”</p>

<p>So Nurse Jane went in the house to give the
breakfast dishes their bath, and put talcum powder
on them, and Uncle Wiggily started off in
his airship for the Wibblewobble duck house to
have the old sofa cushions made over, with new
feathers inside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>Away he sailed, above the tree tops, in the
clothes basket of his airship, with red, white and
blue toy circus balloons lifting him, the Japanese
umbrella keeping off the sun and the electric fan
in the back going around whizzie-izzie, like anything;
if you will kindly allow me to say so.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily sat on the old sofa cushions,
and he did not sail very high up in the air on this
trip.</p>

<p>“For,” said the rabbit gentleman to himself,
“if I should have an accident, and fall from a
great height, I might get hurt, as the cushions are
so thin.”</p>

<p>You see Uncle Wiggily always carried these
sofa cushions in the clothes basket part of his airship,
where he sat to steer it.</p>

<p>Pretty soon he was at the duck house.</p>

<p>“Will you please fix my sofa cushions for me,
by stuffing them with new feathers?” he asked
the duck lady.</p>

<p>“To be sure I will,” answered Mrs. Wibblewobble,
with a polite quack. “Give them to me.”</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily took the sofa cushions out of
his clothes basket airship, and Mrs. Wibblewobble
began filling them with some of her old
feathers she did not need any more. All of a
sudden, along came Lulu Wibblewobble, the
duck girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily!” Lulu cried, “while
you are waiting, please give me a ride in your
airship!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I am afraid I cannot,” he answered.
“You see the sofa cushions are being stuffed by
your mother.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I don’t mind that. Give me a ride
without them!” cried Lulu. “We had examinations
in school to-day, and now I want a little
fun.”</p>

<p>“What examination did you have?” asked the
rabbit gentleman.</p>

<p>“An examination in quacking and in wing
flapping,” answered Lulu. “I think I passed,
too. Teacher said I flapped my wings better
than any other duck girl in the class.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I am glad to hear that!” Uncle Wiggily
cried, for he liked his little duck niece very
much. “And, since you have been such a good
pupil, I will take you up in my airship,” he said.
“Oh, joy!” cried Lulu, flapping her wings and
quacking as she had done in the examinations.</p>

<p>“But we will not go up very high.” Uncle
Wiggily went on. “Since we have not the sofa
cushions with us, we might get hurt if we had an
accident and fell. So I will only take you up a
little way, Lulu.”</p>

<p>“Oh, even a little ride will be lovely!” quacked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
the duck girl. She and Uncle Wiggily got in
the airship, and away they went, about as high as
a jumping rope.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is lovely!” cried Lulu. “Thank you
so much, Uncle Wiggily! It is very good of
you.”</p>

<p>“Pray do not say so,” spoke the old gentleman
rabbit. And then, all at once, something
went wrong with the airship, and it shot up, away
above the trees. Higher and higher it went before
the rabbit gentleman could stop it.</p>

<p>“Oh, if we ever fall now—without our sofa
cushions!” exclaimed Uncle Wiggily, “something
sure will happen!” And then, all of a
sudden, a bad bumble-bee came along, and, with
his sharp stinger, he made holes in the toy balloons
of Uncle Wiggily’s airship, just as a bad
wasp once did. Down the airship began to fall,
faster and faster.</p>

<p>“Oh, if we hit the ground now, with no soft
sofa cushions to sit on, we shall surely be hurt!”
cried Uncle Wiggily. “What shall I do?”</p>

<p>“I know,” cried Lulu Wibblewobble, the
brave duck girl. “I will flap my wings very
hard, just as I did in my school examinations to-day,
and that will make us fall more slowly, so
we will not strike the ground so hard.”</p>

<p>“Please do!” cried Uncle Wiggily. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
Lulu did. Faster and faster she flapped her
wings, beating the air with them, and this kept
up the airship, just as a bird keeps itself up, and
made it fall more and more slowly and gently.</p>

<p>“Look out!” cried the rabbit gentleman, peeping
over the side of the clothes basket. “We are
going to bump!”</p>

<p>But they did not bump very hard. For, just
as they came down to the ground, Mrs. Wibblewobble
had finished stuffing the sofa cushions.
She ran out, and tossed them under Uncle Wiggily’s
airship, and he and Lulu came down on
them as lightly as a feather. But, after all, had
it not been for the duck girl’s wing-flapping, I do
not know what would have happened.</p>

<p>So this is all now, if you please, but if the
tomato doesn’t jump out of the coffee can, and
kiss the cucumber salad in the olive oil, I’ll tell
you next, about Uncle Wiggily and the lemonade
stand.</p>

<span class="fs70">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE LEMONADE STAND</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“My, but it certainly is a warm day!” exclaimed
Uncle Wiggily, the old gentleman rabbit,
as he unbuttoned his fur coat and fanned his
ears with a horse chestnut leaf. “I don’t know
when I have been so warm!”</p>

<p>“It is very hot!” agreed Nurse Jane Fuzzy
Wuzzy, the muskrat lady, as she peeled some
eggs for dinner. “I think I would not go up in
my airship to-day, if I were you, Mr. Longears.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the heat makes no difference to me if I
want to take a ride,” the rabbit gentleman answered.
“Besides, you forget that I have the
big Japanese umbrella over the top of my airship
to keep off the hot sun. Yes, I will take a
ride, and perhaps I may have an adventure; who
knows?”</p>

<p>“True enough—who knows?” repeated Nurse
Jane. “Well, if you will go, Wiggy, I suppose
you will. And, since you are going, would you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
mind stopping at the store and bringing me home
some honey for supper?”</p>

<p>“It will give me the greatest pleasure in the
world to bring you some honey, sweetness,” said
Uncle Wiggily, politely. Sometimes he called
Nurse Jane “sweetness” just for a joke.</p>

<p>Well off the old gentleman started in his
clothes basket airship. It had been all mended
since the time he and Lulu Wibblewobble, the
duck girl, rode in it, when the bumble bee stung
the balloons.</p>

<p>“And the sofa cushions, since Mrs. Wibblewobble
put new feathers in them, are better than
ever,” said Uncle Wiggily. He had the sofa
cushions to fall on, you know.</p>

<p>Well, it kept on getting hotter and hotter that
day, and, not long after Uncle Wiggily had set
off to get the honey for Nurse Jane, Billie Bushytail,
the little squirrel boy, said to his brother
Johnnie:</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what let’s do! Let’s set up a
lemonade stand along the street and sell the nice,
cold, sweet lemonade for five cents a glass.”</p>

<p>“All right!” cried Johnnie. “We’ll do it!”</p>

<p>So they got some old boxes—squirrel size, of
course—and their mamma gave them an old
tablecloth to spread over the top to make the
stand look nice. Then she let the two squirrel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
boys take the proper things to make the lemonade—the
lemons, the sugar, a pitcher, some glasses
and a small piece of ice.</p>

<p>“We’ll make a lot of money, and buy ice cream
cones!” cried Billie.</p>

<p>“That’s what we will!” shouted Johnnie, as
he gnawed the shell off a hickory nut.</p>

<p>Then the squirrel boys squeezed the juice from
the lemons, poured in the water and stirred it up
in the pitcher.</p>

<p>“Say!” exclaimed Billie at that point, “we
ought to have an umbrella over our stand to
make it shady. There’s an old one in the house.
Let’s put it up.”</p>

<p>“All right!” agreed Johnnie, “we will!”
They both ran in the house to get the sun umbrella,
and, while they were gone, a bad monkey
chap, with a very large sweet tooth, sneaked up
to the lemonade stand and took all the sugar.
You see it had not yet been put into the lemonade
pitcher. Yes, sir, the monkey took all the sugar.</p>

<p>And when Billie and Johnnie Bushytail had
fastened the umbrella up over their stand, and
went to look for the sugar to put in the cool lemonade,
why, the sugar was not there! You know
who had it, though Billie and Johnnie did not.</p>

<p>“Oh, what are we going to do?” cried Billie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>“We’ll have to get more sugar!” exclaimed
Johnnie.</p>

<p>But alas! Likewise sorrowfulness! After
giving the squirrel boys the things for the lemonade,
Mrs. Bushytail had gone down to the ten
and five cent store to buy a new dishpan, and had
locked up the squirrel house. For she thought
her boys would not want to go in again until she
came back.</p>

<p>“We can’t get any sugar, and we can’t make
any lemonade!” cried Billie, sadly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes we can,” said his brother. “Let’s
make it sour—without sugar. Perhaps the folks
who buy it won’t mind.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Billie. So they made sour
lemonade.</p>

<p>Then Billie and Johnnie took their places behind
the stand, and cried:</p>

<p>“Here you are! Nice, cold lemonade! Only
five cents a glass!”</p>

<p>You notice they were very careful not to say
“sweet lemonade,” for that would not have been
true.</p>

<p>“Ha! Lemonade!” cried Grandfather
Goosey Gander, coming along just then. “I’ll
take a glass,” and he laid five cents down on the
box. Billie filled a glass for him.</p>

<p>“Whew! Ha! Oh, mercy me! Why it’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
sour!” cried Grandfather Goosey Gander, making
a lot of funny faces as soon as he had sipped
the lemonade.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Billie sadly, “it is sour. Some
one took our sugar.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t drink sour lemonade,” spoke
the duck gentleman, and he took back his five
cents.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” said Johnnie, sadly.</p>

<p>And that’s the way it was. All the animal
folk who came along to drink the cold lemonade
wouldn’t take it when they found it was sour.
They just wrinkled up their noses and took back
their money.</p>

<p>“Here comes Uncle Wiggily in his airship!”
said Billie, after a while. “Maybe he likes sour
lemonade.” So they called to him to come down
and buy some. The rabbit gentleman, sailing
down, laid his nickel on the box. He sipped the
lemonade.</p>

<p>“Oh me! Oh my! and some soda crackers!”
he cried, making his nose twinkle like a star on
a frosty night. “That is too sour!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Billie, sadly. “Some one took our
sugar, and we can’t sell any sweet lemonade, and
get any money for ice cream cones, and our
mamma isn’t home and——”</p>

<p>“Stop! Say no more! You have troubles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
enough!” cried Uncle Wiggily. “I will sweeten
your lemonade for you,” and with that he put
into the pitcher some of the nice sweet honey he
had brought from the store in his airship.</p>

<p>“Oh, joy!” cried Billie and Johnnie, tasting
the lemonade which now was sweet enough
for even Grandfather Goosey Gander. And the
squirrel boys sold one pitcherful and part of another
one. The honey was better than sugar for
sweetening.</p>

<p>They made enough money to buy several ice
cream cones, and they sent Uncle Wiggily one
for giving them the honey, which made their
sour lemonade sweet.</p>

<p>And pretty soon, if the coal man doesn’t slide
a watermelon down the ironing board into the
the refrigerator, I’ll tell you about Uncle Wiggily
and the watering hose.</p>

</div>

<p>Oh, but it was hot in animal land! It was hot and
dry and dusty, for there had been no rain in a
long time, and the sun shone brightly, making
the leaves on the trees curl up in the heat, and
wilting the pretty flowers.</p>

<p>“Well, if we don’t get some rain pretty soon,”
spoke Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat
lady, “the garden will be spoiled, and we can
have no strawberry shortcake.”</p>

<p>“No strawberry shortcake!” cried Uncle
Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman for
whom Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy kept house. “That
will be too bad! But, pray tell me, what has rain
to do with strawberry shortcake, if you please,
Nurse Jane?”</p>

<p>“Rain has everything to do with it, Uncle
Wiggily,” said she. “For if it does not rain,
the strawberries will not grow, and if we do not
have strawberries we can have no shortcake.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
That is, unless I put in lemons instead of strawberries.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! That would never do at all!” exclaimed
Mr. Longears. “We must have strawberries.
I will see what I can do about making
it rain.”</p>

<p>“How can you?” asked Nurse Jane.</p>

<p>“I will go up near the clouds, in my airship,”
spoke the old gentleman rabbit, “and I will see
if there is in them any rain that is ready to fall
down, and wet the thirsty ground. And, maybe,
if there is rain in the clouds I can squeeze a little
out, as you squeeze water from the sponge in the
bath tub.”</p>

<p>“I hope you can,” said Nurse Jane, as she
went out into the garden to pull up some weeds.</p>

<p>Off the old gentleman rabbit started in his
clothes basket airship, on and on, up to the
clouds. But when he got there he saw no rain
in them. The clouds were as dry as a piece of
cheese.</p>

<p>“No, there is no rain here,” said Uncle Wiggily,
sadly. “I wonder what I can do? I would
not like Nurse Jane’s garden to dry up, for I am
very fond of strawberry shortcake. I wonder
what I can do?”</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily in his airship rode on a little
farther, and pretty soon, looking down toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
the earth, over the edge of the clothes basket, he
saw, far below him, some water spurting and
spraying in a beautiful shower.</p>

<p>“Ha! There is rain down there!” the rabbit
gentleman cried. “I wonder why there is none
over at our place? I must go down and see.”</p>

<p>So down he went, and there he saw Jackie and
Peetie Bow Wow, the two puppy dog boys,
squirting water with a hose, which was fastened
to the faucet of the kitchen sink.</p>

<p>“Now it’s my turn to squirt!” cried Jackie, as
Uncle Wiggily jumped out of his airship, which
had reached the ground.</p>

<p>“No, let me squirt just a little bit more!”
begged Peetie, and his brother very kindly did.</p>

<p>“Ha! What have you there?” asked the old
gentleman rabbit, as he went toward the puppy
dog boys.</p>

<p>“A watering hose,” said Jackie. “You see it
hasn’t rained for so long that our garden is all
dried up. So papa got this hose. See, this is how
it squirts.”</p>

<p>And just then Peetie accidentally moved the
end of the hose too much, and a shower of water
went all over Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Peetie, “I didn’t mean to do
that.”</p>

<p>“I’ll forgive you!” laughed Uncle Wiggily.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
“It is so warm that it feels fine to have a hose
squirted on you so I don’t care. I must get one
for Nurse Jane.”</p>

<p>Then it was Jackie’s turn to squirt the hose,
and when Peetie handed it to him, the end slipped
again, and Grandfather Goosey Gander, who
came along just then, was sprayed with a shower
of water.</p>

<p>“Oh dear! I’m so sorry!” cried Jackie.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter at all!” cried the old gentleman
goose. “I just love water!” And the
drops rolled off his back, not wetting him at all,
for a goose gentleman’s feathers are made to shed
water, just as an umbrella does, you know.</p>

<p>“Let me try the hose,” begged Uncle Wiggily,
and Jackie did so. “Yes, I really must get
Nurse Jane one,” said the rabbit gentleman.
“It is as good as a rain shower,” and he sprinkled
water all over the dog-garden.</p>

<p>Then off he went in his airship to get a watering
hose for his garden, leaving Peetie and
Jackie to sprinkle theirs, sometimes wetting the
sidewalk and sometimes spraying the animal
people who went past, just as puppy dog boys
will, you know.</p>

<p>“Ha! Now we won’t mind whether or not it
rains!” cried Uncle Wiggily, when he reached
his hollow stump bungalow again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Nurse Jane, fanning herself
with the dishpan. “It is hotter than ever.
We need rain very badly.”</p>

<p>“And we shall have it!” exclaimed the old
gentleman rabbit. “See, I have a watering
hose,” and he took one from his airship. He had
bought it at the rubber store.</p>

<p>Soon the hose was attached to the kitchen
faucet, and Uncle Wiggily watered the garden.
And how the flowers and the lima beans and the
strawberry plants lifted up their tired, dusty hot
leaves, and drank the cool water that was
showered on them.</p>

<p>And then, when the garden was nicely watered,
Uncle Wiggily heard a noise out in the street,
and a tired voice said:</p>

<p>“Oh dear! How hot I am! Oh dear!”</p>

<p>“Ha! Some one in trouble!” remarked Uncle
Wiggily. “I must see if I cannot help them.”
He went out in front, and there he saw a poor,
tired, dusty ice-wagon horse, who could hardly
hold up his head.</p>

<p>“I will water you with the hose,” said the rabbit
gentleman. “That will cool you off, and rest
you.”</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/p160.jpg" alt="Uncle Wiggily getting sprayed with hose">
</figure>

<p>“Please do,” begged the ice-wagon horse, and
Uncle Wiggily did. And when the cool water
sprayed on the hot and tired horse he felt so much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>better that he laughed, and held up his head, and
he gave Uncle Wiggily a big cake of ice, like the
one Mr. Whitewash, the Polar bear gentleman,
sits on, and the ice made the hollow stump bungalow
so cool that Uncle Wiggily had a fine sleep
that night.</p>

<p>And the next day it rained, so Uncle Wiggily
did not have to water with the hose. And this
shows that you should always be kind to an ice-wagon
horse when you can.</p>

<p>So if the popcorn ball doesn’t play lawn tennis
with the refrigerator and get all melted up, I’ll
tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the
thunder storm.</p>

<span class="fs70">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE THUNDER STORM</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Well, how is your garden coming on these
days?” asked Uncle Wiggily Longears, the rabbit
gentleman, of Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the
muskrat lady, who kept house for him. “It isn’t
drying up any more; is it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” she answered, as she tied her long
tail in a double knot to keep it from dragging in
the dust. “Since you so kindly bought me the
watering hose, I can wet the garden whether it
rains or not. And that will make everything
grow.”</p>

<p>“Strawberries too? Will it make them
grow?” Uncle Wiggily wanted to know. He
was thinking of strawberry shortcake, I guess,
for he was very fond of it.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, the strawberries are growing very
nicely,” said Nurse Jane, as she looked for the
red berries under the green leaves.</p>

<p>“And I think you will not have to water with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
the hose for several days now,” the muskrat lady
went on, as she glanced up at the sky.</p>

<p>“Why not?” Uncle Wiggily wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Because we are going to have a thunder
shower,” said the muskrat lady. “And I think
it will be quite a hard one. But it is always cooler
after a thunder shower and I like them very
much.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” agreed Uncle Wiggily. “But if
it is going to rain and thunder and lighten I had
better go for a ride in my airship as soon as possible.
Much as I like storms, I do not want to be
caught out in one up in the sky, in my airship.”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you are going, you had better go, and
hurry back,” advised Nurse Jane.</p>

<p>So the old gentleman rabbit went out in the
woodshed where he kept his airship, and after
shaking up the sofa cushions in the clothes basket,
so they would be soft and fluffy for him to
fall on, in case of any accident, Uncle Wiggily
blew some hot air into the toy circus balloons that
raised his airship from the ground and then,
starting the electric fan, that went around
whizzie-izzie, up he rose into the air.</p>

<p>“Yes, I really think there will be a thunder
storm soon,” said the old rabbit to himself, as he
looked at the clouds, which were getting more
and more black. “I am glad I brought along an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
umbrella,” for he had one, you see, in addition to
the Japanese sun parasol that was over the top
of the red, white and blue toy circus balloons.</p>

<p>Well, Uncle Wiggily was sailing around and
around, looking for an adventure, when all at
once he saw, a little distance away, the spire of
a church steeple.</p>

<p>“I’ll sail over as far as that steeple,” said the
old gentleman rabbit to himself, “and then I’ll
go back home. Nurse Jane may get nervous if
I stay away too long, with a thunder storm coming
up.”</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily was almost at the church
steeple, when he saw a big robin red-breast flying
through the air. And, just as the bird was near
the church spire, there came a strong blast of
wind from the storm, dashing poor robin against
the hard steeple, which had an arrow on top to
tell the way the wind was blowing.</p>

<p>“Oh dear!” cried the robin. “My wing is
broken and I cannot fly any more, I will fall to
the ground, and die!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no you will not,” said Uncle Wiggily
kindly. “I will catch you on the soft sofa cushions
of my airship.” Then the rabbit gentleman
sent his airship right under the falling birdie, and
caught it just before it struck the ground.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you!” cried robin red-breast.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
“You have saved my life, but my wing is
broken!”</p>

<p>“Never mind. We will have Dr. Possum
mend that,” said Uncle Wiggily. “I’ll take you
to the animal doctor.” He started off in the airship
again, but, before he had gone very far, there
was a rumble in the sky. Then came a flash of
lightning and a big boom, like that of a Fourth
of July cannon. And then it began to rain very
hard.</p>

<p>“Ha! Here is the thunder storm!” cried
Uncle Wiggily, “and I am far from home and
Nurse Jane. We had better go down and stay
in one of these houses, until the storm is over, Mr.
Bird.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the robin with a broken wing, “I
think perhaps we had better do that.”</p>

<p>Down went Uncle Wiggily in his airship. It
was raining very hard now, and the lightning
flashed, and the thunder rolled and rumbled very
loudly indeed.</p>

<p>“There is a good house near that pond and
barn, for us to go in out of the storm!” cried the
rabbit gentleman, pointing with one ear down below,
for he needed both paws with which to steer.
“It is the duck pen where my friends, the Wibblewobbles,
live. I’ll go there,” Uncle Wiggily
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>Down went the airship, close to the barn, where
Gup, the kind horse lived.</p>

<p>“You hurry right into the duck pen!” cried
Gup to Uncle Wiggily. “I’ll take your airship
in my stable until the storm is over.”</p>

<p>So Uncle Wiggily hurried into the duck pen,
taking the poor robin with him, and, no sooner
was the rabbit gentleman inside, than he heard
Lulu and Alice, the duck girls, crying as hard as
they could cry.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with them?” he asked
of Mrs. Wibblewobble.</p>

<p>“They are afraid of the thunder storm,” said
the duck lady. And Lulu and Alice were lying
in a dark room, with pillows over their heads so
as not to see the lightning, and hear the thunder.
As for Jimmie, the boy duck, of course he was
not afraid. Boys, whether they are ducks or not,
are never afraid of thunder storms.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t mind the thunder storm,” said
Uncle Wiggily, to Lulu and Alice. “It will not
hurt you. Just pretend that the thunder is only
the noise of a big circus wagon going over a
bridge, and the lightning is only electric flashes
from a trolley car. Then you will not mind it
so much.”</p>

<p>So Lulu and Alice pretended that way, and the
robin with the broken wing sang for them, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
soon the thunder storm was over, and never after
that were the duck girls frightened. For whenever
it thundered, Lulu would say:</p>

<p>“Ha! That is only a circus wagon going over
a bridge.”</p>

<p>And when it lightened, Alice would say:</p>

<p>“That is only a trolley car going up hill.”</p>

<p>Then, when the rain had stopped, Uncle Wiggily
went sailing on in his airship, taking the poor
robin to Dr. Possum, who soon mended the bird’s
broken wing.</p>

<p>So you see it is sometimes good to have a thunder
storm, after all, and in the following story,
if the hoptoad in our back yard doesn’t jump over
the fence and tickle the pansy’s face, I’ll tell
you about Uncle Wiggily and the trunk.</p>

<span class="fs70">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE TRUNK</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Are you going to do very much to-day?”
asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat
lady, of Uncle Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman,
who was reading the fly paper out on the
front porch one morning. He wanted to read
the fly paper because it told about how to get rid
of biting mosquitoes.</p>

<p>“Am I going to do very much?” Uncle Wiggily
repeated after Nurse Jane. “Well, I was
going out for a little trip in my airship, but if
there is anything you would like me to do, why,
I can just as well do it as not,” he said, most
politely. “I can go airshipping later.”</p>

<p>“Then, if you will be so kind,” spoke Nurse
Jane, “will you get a trunk for me out of the
attic?”</p>

<p>“Certainly I’ll do that for you,” Uncle Wiggily
promised. “Do you want an elephant’s
trunk?” he asked with a funny little twinkle of
his nose, “or will you have the trunk of a tree?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, there you go! Joking again!” cried
Nurse Jane. “What would I do with an
elephant’s trunk?”</p>

<p>“Why, I didn’t know but what you might be
going to give a circus,” said Uncle Wiggily with
a laugh, “and they always have an elephant’s
trunk in the circus.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not going to have a circus,” declared
Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy. “And what, pray,
would I want with the trunk of a tree?”</p>

<p>“Why, I thought perhaps you might want to
have me split it up for kindling wood, for the
fire,” went on Uncle Wiggily, as he stuck the
sticky fly paper on the porch screen, so it would
not blow away.</p>

<p>“Enough of your jokes!” cried Nurse Jane,
as she put her long tail up in curl papers, so she
would look nice if any one asked her to go to a
party. “The trunk I want is an empty one from
the attic. I need it to pack away some of your
suits, to keep the moths from eating them this
summer. Just get down one of the clothes
trunks, Wiggy. Put it in your room, and I’ll
pack away the things you will not need until next
winter.”</p>

<p>“Very well, I’ll do that,” the rabbit gentleman
said kindly, and then he went up in the attic of
the hollow stump bungalow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>The attic was rather a dark and dusty place;
and, as it was near the top of the house, where the
sun shone on it as hard as it could, it was quite
warm up there.</p>

<p>“Humph! Yes! Bring down a trunk,” said
Uncle Wiggily to himself, looking around.
“There are a lot of trunks here. I wonder which
one Nurse Jane meant?”</p>

<p>He glanced at a pile of several trunks, and
finally he decided that the one painted red, white
and blue, as was his barber pole rheumatism
crutch, would be the best.</p>

<p>“I’ll take that trunk down for Nurse Jane,”
said Uncle Wiggily, as he lifted it off the pile of
others. “My! But it’s heavy!” he exclaimed.
“I must see what’s in it.”</p>

<p>He opened the trunk and in it the old gentleman
rabbit saw a number of play toys he had had
when he was a little boy rabbit. There were baseballs
and bats, and toy bows and arrows, and fish
poles, and pop guns, and many other things.</p>

<p>“My! This makes me remember the happy
days when I was young!” sighed Uncle Wiggily.
“I certainly used to have fun when I was
a boy. I’ll just take these things out of my
trunk, and save them for Sammie Littletail, the
rabbit boy, and for Johnnie and Billie Bushytail,
the squirrels. Then I’ll take the empty trunk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
down to Nurse Jane. Yes, those were happy
days, when I was a young rabbit boy.”</p>

<p>The old gentleman rabbit began emptying the
trunk, taking out his old play toys, and, when
he had the trunk emptied he felt rather tired. It
was hot up in the attic, and he felt sleepy, also.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll just lie down on the trunk and
take a nap,” Uncle Wiggily said. “There is
really no hurry about taking it downstairs.”</p>

<p>Into the empty trunk he hopped, and for a
pillow he took a soft baseball, which had been
batted about so much that it was quite mushy.</p>

<p>Soon, up in the trunk in the warm attic, Uncle
Wiggily was fast asleep.</p>

<p>And then something dreadful happened. A
big rat, who had had nothing to eat in a long
time, crawled out of his hole, looking for a piece
of cheese. The rat saw the trunk, with the lid up,
and he thought to himself:</p>

<p>“Maybe there is cheese in there. I’ll take a
look.”</p>

<p>He jumped up on the lid of the trunk, and the
rat was so heavy that he accidentally slammed
the cover down, shutting Uncle Wiggily inside
the trunk.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” cried the rat. “Now I have done
it! I’m so sorry!”</p>

<p>“And so am I!” cried Uncle Wiggily from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
inside the trunk. For the banging down of the
lid had awakened him.</p>

<p>“Can’t you get out?” asked the rat. “Try to
lift up the lid. I’ll help you.”</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily tried, and so did the hungry
rat, but the trunk cover had locked itself when
it fell down, and Uncle Wiggily could not get
out.</p>

<p>“Oh, I shall smother in here!” cried the rabbit
gentleman. “Help! Help!”</p>

<p>“I’ll run downstairs and get the key from
Nurse Jane,” the rat said. “Then I can let you
out.” But Nurse Jane had gone to the store, and
the rat could not find the key. Up to the attic
he ran again, saying: “Oh, Uncle Wiggily,
what shall I do? I can’t get the trunk key to let
you out!”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” cried the rabbit gentleman. “I
must get out! I am smothering in here.”</p>

<p>“Ha! I know what I can do!” suddenly
cried the rat! “I can gnaw a hole in the trunk,
and you can crawl out that way!”</p>

<p>So the hungry rat, with his strong teeth,
quickly gnawed a hole in the side of the trunk,
and Uncle Wiggily hopped out just before
he smothered, so it was all right. Then he
took the trunk downstairs, mended the rat hole
in it and gave the kind rat something to eat, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
the rat had not in the least meant to close down
the trunk lid, you see.</p>

<p>Then Nurse Jane came back and packed away
Uncle Wiggily’s clothes in the moth stuff, and
the old rabbit gentleman tied up in bundles the
toys he intended giving to the little animal boys,
and that’s the end of this story. But, if the
ice water pitcher doesn’t go to sleep under the gas
stove and make the oven sneeze, when the rice
pudding tickles the baked potatoes, I’ll tell you
next about Uncle Wiggily going to school.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="STORY_XXVIII">STORY XXVIII<br>
<span class="fs70">UNCLE WIGGILY GOES TO SCHOOL</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It was a beautiful day in animal land. Uncle
Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman, who
was cleaning the mud off his airship (for he had
fallen into a puddle the day before) looked up at
the blue sky and said:</p>

<p>“Ah, it is such a beautiful day that traveling
around in my airship will be a delight. I will
sail off and perhaps something may happen to
me. That will be an adventure.”</p>

<p>He kept on cleaning the mud off the clothes
basket of his airship, and then he softly fluffed
up the sofa cushions that kept him from getting
hurt when he fell from the clouds.</p>

<p>“Now I am ready to start,” Uncle Wiggily
said, as he put a piece of cherry pie in his vest
pocket, to have it ready to eat in case he became
hungry. I mean he was going to eat the cherry
pie, not his vest pocket, you understand.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” asked Nurse Jane
Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady, coming to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
door of the hollow stump bungalow, which she
kept in order for Uncle Wiggily. “Where are
you going?” asked Nurse Jane as she washed
and wiped the face of a breakfast plate.</p>

<p>“Oh just to take a little trip, and perhaps
have an adventure,” Uncle Wiggily said.</p>

<p>“Well, please bring home some pickled
bananas for breakfast,” went on Nurse Jane, and
Uncle Wiggily promised he would.</p>

<p>Then he started off in his airship, but he had
not gone very far before he saw, down on the
ground below him, something red, white and blue,
fluttering in the wind.</p>

<p>“Ha! I wonder if that can be my red,
white and blue striped barber pole rheumatism
crutch?” said the rabbit gentleman. “It must
have fallen out of my airship.”</p>

<p>Then he looked among the sofa cushions and
went on:</p>

<p>“No, my crutch is here safe and sound. But
I wonder what that red, white and blue is down
there? I’m going to see.”</p>

<p>He steered his airship downward, and when
he reached the ground Uncle Wiggily found
that what he had seen was a fluttering flag, with
red and white stripes, and white stars on a blue
square. And the flag was on a pole in front of
an animal school house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>“Ha! Of course! I might have known!”
cried Uncle Wiggily. “Well, since I am so near
school, I will go in and see the nice lady mouse
teacher and the animal children.”</p>

<p>Then he tied his airship to a mulberry bush, so
it could not run away, and where it would also
have something to eat, and into the school went
the rabbit gentleman.</p>

<p>“Good morning, children,” said Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Uncle Wiggily,” replied the
pupils, most politely.</p>

<p>“What is going on here?” asked Uncle Wiggily
of the lady mouse school teacher, for all the
animal children were standing up in a row before
her desk. “Have the children not been good?”
the rabbit gentleman wanted to know, looking
at Charlie Chick and at Johnnie and Billie
Bushytail.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, indeed! The children are as good
as pie!” said the teacher with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Ha! Speaking of pie, reminds me that I
have some,” exclaimed Uncle Wiggily, as he took
the cherry piece out of his vest pocket. “If you
will kindly allow me I will pass it around,” he
went on.</p>

<p>“Yes, you may do so,” spoke the teacher.
And the piece of cherry pie Uncle Wiggily had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
brought with him was so large that there was
enough for each animal pupil to have some as well
as Uncle Wiggily himself, and also the lady
mouse school teacher.</p>

<p>“But, tell me, pray, why are your pupils
standing in a line this way?” asked the rabbit
gentleman, when the pie was all eaten.</p>

<p>“We are having an examination,” the teacher
replied. “It is nearing the time to close the
school for the summer, and I am trying to find
out how much my pupils know, so that if they
are smart enough they can go to a higher class.
We are having an examination, you see.”</p>

<p>“An examination in what?” asked Uncle
Wiggily.</p>

<p>“In spelling,” answered the lady mouse.
“Would you like to ask them to spell some
words?”</p>

<p>“I should be delighted,” went on the rabbit
gentleman. Then, looking straight at Sammie
Littletail, the rabbit boy, Uncle Wiggily said:</p>

<p>“Spell me the word carrot!”</p>

<p>“C-a-r-r-o-t,” spelled Sammie. He knew that
word very well, you see, because he ate carrots
every day.</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Uncle Wiggily. Then he
looked at Billie Bushytail, the squirrel, and said:</p>

<p>“Spell me the word peanut!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>“P-e-a-n-u-t,” spelled Billie the first time.</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Uncle Wiggily. Then he
looked at Charlie, the chicken boy, and said:</p>

<p>“Spell me the word corn!”</p>

<p>But before Charlie had a chance to do this, all
of a sudden into the school jumped a bad old
Flippity-flop. A Flippity-flop is an animal,
something like a mouse-trap, only it walks on its
head instead of on its toes, and it has no tail.</p>

<p>“Wow!” cried the bad Flippity-flop.
“Here’s where I have some fun!” And that unpleasant
creature began to throw pieces of chalk
and the blackboard erasers around the room, and
he upset the ink bottle on the floor and tickled the
lady mouse teacher with a lead pencil point.
Oh, the Flippity-flop was very bad, and for no
reason at all, except just because he wanted to be
so. Flippity-flops are always like that.</p>

<p>“Oh, what shall we do?” cried the lady mouse,
for the children were all excited. “Call a policeman
dog for me, Uncle Wiggily, to take away the
bad Flippity-flop!”</p>

<p>“Ha! I will make the Flippity-flop go away
myself!” cried Uncle Wiggily very bravely.</p>

<p>“No you cannot!” shouted the Flippity-flop,
as he made a face at the rabbit gentleman. “You
cannot make me go away!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I can!” said Uncle Wiggily in a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
loud voice. “You spell me the word cheese!
quick now! Spell me cheese!”</p>

<p>“Oh, wow!” cried the Flippity-flop, and then,
as quick as a wink, he turned a somersault and
hopped out the window, and ran off to the woods
to hide. For if there is one thing more than another
that a Flippity-flop is afraid of it is cheese,
especially rabbit cheese.</p>

<p>And he could no more spell the word than he
could fly, and that’s why he ran away, and every
one was glad. And I guess you are, too.</p>

<p>“Thank you, very much, Uncle Wiggily,”
said the lady mouse teacher “for driving away
the bad Flippity-flop!” Then the examination
went on, and all the animal children passed,
and Uncle Wiggily bought some pickled bananas
and went on home to Nurse Jane.</p>

<p>And next, if the dogwood tree doesn’t bark at
the pussy willow and make its tail fluff up, I’ll
tell you about Uncle Wiggily and Nurse Jane.</p>

<span class="fs70">UNCLE WIGGILY AND NURSE JANE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Well, are you all ready?” asked Uncle
Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman, of
Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady
housekeeper, as he came hurrying into the hollow
stump bungalow one afternoon. “Are you all
ready, Nurse Jane?”</p>

<p>“Ready? Ready for what?” she cried, as she
sat down backwards in the dishpan full of soap
bubbles, she was so excited.</p>

<p>“Why, ready to go to the country, of course,”
replied the old gentleman rabbit. “We are
going to spend a few days in the woods, and
amid the green fields. I thought I told you about
it. But perhaps I forgot it. However, no matter.
Come, pack your trunk, and we will go off
to the country in my airship.”</p>

<p>“My goodness me sakes alive, and some molasses
lollypops!” cried Nurse Jane. “This is a
great surprise to me!”</p>

<p>“Is it?” asked Uncle Wiggily. “Well, I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
sorry I forgot to tell you about it. But never
mind. Pack your trunk and mine, and we will
start in the morning.”</p>

<p>Then such goings-on as there were in the hollow
stump bungalow! Nurse Jane had so much
to do to get ready that all Uncle Wiggily had for
his supper was some of the hollow rings from the
inside of the crullers, and a few of the holes in
Swiss cheese, fried in marshmallow sauce.</p>

<p>“But I don’t mind,” the rabbit gentleman
said. “We will have plenty to eat when we get
to the country, Nurse Jane.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” answered the muskrat lady, as
she tied her tail up in curl papers to make it nice
and frizzy for morning.</p>

<p>As soon as the sun had gotten up out of bed
next day, and washed its face, Uncle Wiggily
and Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy started off for the country
in the clothes basket airship, with the red,
white and blue toy circus balloons lifting it high
above the tree tops.</p>

<p>They took with them a trunk and a satchel,
containing their clothes, for they were to stay,
perhaps, a week or more. And they also had their
toothbrushes, for Uncle Wiggily was very particular
about cleaning his teeth.</p>

<p>“Ah, there is the bungalow where we are to
stay,” said the rabbit gentleman, as he sailed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
above a pretty place in the woods. “See it down
there, Nurse Jane.”</p>

<p>He pointed to a little house made of bark. It
was close to the edge of a little brook, and all
about it grew ferns and bluebell flowers.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a lovely place!” cried Nurse Jane.
“I know I shall like it there!”</p>

<p>Down went the airship as gently as a feather,
and out jumped the muskrat lady and Uncle
Wiggily.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Uncle Wiggily, as he tied his airship
fast to a willow-whistle tree, so that it would
not run away and play tag with the clouds;
“now, Nurse Jane, I’ll cut you some wood to
make a fire, and you can get dinner. Then we’ll
take a walk in the forest.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the muskrat lady, and while
Uncle Wiggily was gnawing the firewood into
little sticks with his strong teeth, Miss Fuzzy
Wuzzy opened the box of good things to eat,
which they had brought with them in the airship.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll just take a little hop through the
woods, while you are getting dinner ready,” said
Uncle Wiggily, after a bit. “I may find an adventure.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” spoke Nurse Jane, as she put on
a pocket handkerchief apron so she would not
spatter carrot juice on her shirtwaist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>Well, Uncle Wiggily had not gone very far
before, all of a sudden, he heard Nurse Jane
crying out:</p>

<p>“Help! Help! Help! Oh, Uncle Wiggily,
come here quickly!”</p>

<p>“My goodness me, sakes alive and some cinnamon
ice cream!” cried the rabbit gentleman.
“Nurse Jane must be in trouble.”</p>

<p>He gave three hops and a skip through the
woods, and soon he was at the birch-bark bungalow,
near the brook.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Nurse Jane?” he asked,
breathless like.</p>

<p>“Oh, I heard the most dreadful noise!” she
said. “Listen!”</p>

<p>Then Uncle Wiggily heard:</p>

<p>“Baa! Baa! Baa!”</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha!” laughed the rabbit gentleman.
“That is only a sheep singing. You will find
plenty of them in the country, Nurse Jane.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Only a sheep,” said the muskrat lady.
“I thought maybe it was an alligator. I am not
afraid of a sheep.”</p>

<p>Then she went on getting dinner, and Uncle
Wiggily went back in the woods, looking for an
adventure, and, pretty soon he heard Nurse Jane
cry again:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily! Help! Help! Help!
Come quickly!”</p>

<p>With three hops, and part of another one, the
old rabbit gentleman was back at the birch-bark
bungalow.</p>

<p>“What is the matter now?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Listen,” spoke Nurse Jane, just like a
telephone girl.</p>

<p>Then Uncle Wiggily heard a noise that went:</p>

<p>“Gobble-obble-obble! Gobble-obble-obble!”</p>

<p>“What terrible creature is that?” asked Nurse
Jane, shivering.</p>

<p>“Only a Thanksgiving turkey gobbler,”
laughed the old gentleman rabbit. “They are
always in the country. Don’t be afraid.”</p>

<p>He went back in the woods again, but pretty
soon Nurse Jane cried once more.</p>

<p>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily! Come here quickly.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what can be the matter this time?”
thought the old rabbit gentleman, as he gave a
hop, skip and a jump back. “What is it, Miss
Fuzzy Wuzzy?” he asked, as he came to the
birch-bark bungalow.</p>

<p>“Oh, we have no milk for dinner,” she said
sorrowfully.</p>

<p>And, before Uncle Wiggily could answer,
there echoed through the woods a sound like:</p>

<p>“Moo! Moo! Moo!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, what dreadful creature is that?” asked
Nurse Jane, wiggling her whiskers. “I am sure
it must be a bear.”</p>

<p>“Ha!” cried Uncle Wiggily. “That is not
a bear! It is our milk for dinner. That is the
moo-cow. You will find lots of them in the country.
You must not be so nervous, Nurse Jane.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try not to be,” she answered, “but it is
some time since I have lived in the country.
Where is the cow?”</p>

<p>Then along came a nice moo-cow with milk
for Uncle Wiggily’s dinner, and the rabbit and
Nurse Jane had a fine time in the country-woods
bungalow, and they thanked the kind cow and
Nurse Fuzzy Wuzzy said she would not be afraid
of any more funny noises. But you just wait!</p>

<p>Now, in the next story, if the circus lemonade
doesn’t jump over the elephant’s back, and color
the clown’s white suit all over with pink stripes,
like a stick of peppermint candy, I’ll tell you
about Uncle Wiggily and the moo-cow.</p>

<span class="fs70">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE MOO-COW</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Hey, Uncle Wiggily!” suddenly exclaimed
Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy in the middle of the
night.</p>

<p>“Yes, what is it?” asked the rabbit gentleman
in a sleepy voice.</p>

<p>“Listen!” went on the muskrat lady.</p>

<p>So Uncle Wiggily listened, just as if a nice
telephone girl had told him to do so. He and
Nurse Jane were spending a few days in the
country woods bungalow, as I told you in the
story before this one. It was their first night,
and, about twelve o’clock, the muskrat lady had
all at once awakened the old gentleman rabbit by
calling to him.</p>

<p>“Did you hear that?” asked Nurse Jane, after
a bit.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily heard a sound that went something
like: “Chir-r-r-r-r-p! Chir-r-r-r-r-p!
Chir-r-r-r-r-p!”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="p186" style="max-width: 38.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p186.jpg" alt="Bull in airship">
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>“Do you hear that?” asked Nurse Jane in a
whisper.</p>

<p>“Surely I hear it,” answered Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>“That is a bad old fox, sawing the bolt off the
front door with a screw driver, so he can get in,”
went on the muskrat lady.</p>

<p>“Nonsencicalness!” laughed Uncle Wiggily.
“It is only a black cricket. They always chirp
that way, to make the country more cheerful.
There are many crickets in the country. Go to
sleep, Nurse Jane.”</p>

<p>So the muskrat lady went to sleep once more,
rather sorry for having awakened Uncle Wiggily.
But pretty soon, when it was almost morning,
she called out again:</p>

<p>“Uncle Wiggily, did you hear that?”</p>

<p>“Hear what?” asked the rabbit gentleman, in
a sleepy voice.</p>

<p>“Some one outside the bungalow is calling
about a little girl named Katy. Some one says
she did do it, and some one else says she didn’t
do it. I’m sure something dreadful must have
happened. Listen!”</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily listened. He heard: “Katy-did!
Katy-did! Katy-didn’t! Katy-didn’t!”</p>

<p>“Hal Ha!” laughed the old rabbit gentleman.
“That noise is made by a little green bug,
called a ‘Katy-did.’ There are two of them; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
other being called a ‘Katy-didn’t.’ And they are
always disputing that way. Go to sleep, Nurse
Jane. There are many Katy-dids and didn’ts in
the country.”</p>

<p>“Then there isn’t any little girl Katy out in
the woods?” asked the muskrat lady, curious like.</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” answered Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>So everything was all right until the sun got
up out of bed again, and washed his face in
the little pond near the birch bark bungalow
where Uncle Wiggily and Nurse Jane were
staying for a while.</p>

<p>All of a sudden there was a rustling in the
bushes near the pond, and a voice cried:</p>

<p>“Moo! Moo! Moo!”</p>

<p>“Ha! I know what that is,” exclaimed Nurse
Jane. “That is the Moo-Cow coming with milk
for our breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” spoke the rabbit gentleman.</p>

<p>“Here I am!” said the cow in a cheerful voice,
and after she had given Nurse Jane the morning
milk, and the rabbit gentleman had had his
breakfast, the Moo-Cow asked:</p>

<p>“Uncle Wiggily, what is that funny thing
over there? It looks like a clothes basket, filled
with sofa cushions, with an electric fan in back,
and toy circus balloons and a Japanese umbrella
on top. What is it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>“That is my airship, if you please,” Uncle
Wiggily replied, as he tied his long ears in a hard
knot so they would not be in his way. “Perhaps
you would like to take a ride with me, Moo-Cow.”</p>

<p>“I should like it, above all things!” answered
the Moo-Cow.</p>

<p>“Come then, and I will take you—above all
things!” laughed Uncle Wiggily. “We will go
even up above the church steeples.”</p>

<p>“But don’t fall on any of them, for they are
very sharp,” said Nurse Jane. “They are even
sharper than the horns of the Moo-Cow.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be careful,” promised Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>So he and the Moo-Cow took their places in the
clothes basket of the airship. Uncle Wiggily
blew up the balloons with hot air, and then, starting
the electric fan, that went around whizzie-izzie,
off they sailed over the tree-tops.</p>

<p>“Ha! This is fine!” cried the Moo-Cow.</p>

<p>“Were you never airshipping before?” inquired
Uncle Wiggily, politely.</p>

<p>“Never,” answered the Moo-Cow, as she carefully
braided the tufted end of her tail, so it
would not tickle Uncle Wiggily. “It is very
kind of you to ask me for a ride,” she went on.</p>

<p>“Pray do not mention such a little thing as
that,” spoke the rabbit gentleman still more
politely. “I am glad you like it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>Well, Uncle Wiggily and the Moo-Cow rode
on and on in the airship, and Mr. Longears was
afraid he was not going to have an adventure
that day, when, all of a sudden there came a
strong puff of wind. It blew the red, white and
blue toy balloons down upon the sharp points of
the Moo-Cow’s horns, and, all at once, there was
a hiss, like that of a radiator on a cold day, and
all the air rushed out of the balloons, leaving
them flat like cocoanut cakes. Down went the
airship; down—down!</p>

<p>“Oh, we are falling!” cried the Moo-Cow. “I
am going to jump over the moon! That is the
only way I can save myself!”</p>

<p>“Stop! Sit still!” cried Uncle Wiggily like
a policeman life-saver dog at Asbury Park.
“Do not jump over the moon, or anywhere else.”</p>

<p>“But we are falling down!” cried the cow.
“We shall be hurt when we hit the ground. I
must jump before it is too late.”</p>

<p>“Stay right in!” said Uncle Wiggily, as he
steered the falling airship out of the way of a
church steeple. “The soft sofa cushions, filled
with Wibblewobble duck feathers, will not let us
be hurt. We will fall on them!” cried the rabbit
gentleman. “Don’t be in the least afraid.
We shall fall on the cushions!”</p>

<p>And, surely enough they did. Down they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
came on the hard ground, but with the sofa cushions
under them it was like falling on a feather
bed, so neither the rabbit gentleman nor the Moo-Cow
was hurt in the least. The cow was sorry
her sharp horns had burst the balloons, but Uncle
Wiggily politely said that did not in the least
matter.</p>

<p>“I can easily mend them again,” he declared.
“And maybe I shall have another adventure to-morrow.”</p>

<p>He did, and what it was I shall have the pleasure
of telling you in the next story—that is if the
lawn mower doesn’t run out in the street and cut
the wheels off the automobile so the rag doll
has to ride in the express wagon. The story will
be about Uncle Wiggily and the sheep.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="STORY_XXXI">STORY XXXI<br>
<span class="fs70">UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE SHEEP</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat
lady, was sweeping and dusting the birch-bark
bungalow, in the country woods, where she and
Uncle Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman,
were spending a few days’ vacation.</p>

<p>“It is very nice here,” thought Nurse Jane, as
she put some flowers in the dishpan to make the
kitchen table look decorated. “I am glad we
came.”</p>

<p>And she looked out of the window to see what
Mr. Longears was doing. He was pumping
some hot air into the red, white and blue circus
balloons of his airship. He had mended them
after the Moo-Cow’s horns had accidentally
punctured holes in them, as I told you last night,
if you will kindly remember.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess Uncle Wiggily is going for
a ride,” said Nurse Jane. “I must ask him to
stop at the store for a pound of sugar.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>And then the muskrat lady began singing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Baa, baa, black sheep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Have you any wool?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yes, sir! Yes, sir!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Three bags full.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">One for the master,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">One for the man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And one for the little boy</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Who lives in the lane.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Ha! Are you singing about me?” asked a
voice near a Jack-in-the-pulpit flower which
grew at the side porch of the bungalow. “Are
you singing about me, Nurse Jane?”</p>

<p>“Why, I suppose I was, if you are Baa-Baa
Black Sheep,” replied the muskrat lady, while
she polished the potatoes for dinner.</p>

<p>“Well, I am a white sheep, but my name is
Baa-Baa, just the same,” went on the voice, and
around the corner came the same sheep that had
accidentally frightened Nurse Jane the first
night she and Uncle Wiggily had come to the
bungalow.</p>

<p>“Oh, how do you do?” asked Nurse Jane, for
she was not frightened any more, since she knew
the sheep was a kind one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>“I am very well,” replied the sheep. “And
I have brought you some butter, made from yellow
buttercup flowers,” and with that the kind
sheep took, from where it was tied to his horns,
a nice package of sweet butter, wrapped in cool,
green leaves. “My wife made it,” said the
sheep. “She is a very good butter maker.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that is very kind of her, I am sure.
Thank you!” exclaimed Nurse Jane. “Uncle
Wiggily,” she called, “see what Mr. Baa-Baa
has brought us—some lovely butter.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sure that is very nice,” spoke the
rabbit gentleman, as he finished making his airship
ready for a trip. “Would you like to come
for a ride with me, Baa-Baa?” asked the rabbit
gentleman.</p>

<p>“I would if I could be sure we would not fall,”
said the sheep gentleman.</p>

<p>“Well, even if we do fall we will not get hurt,”
Uncle Wiggily answered. “The Moo-Cow and
I fell yesterday, but the soft sofa cushions in the
clothes basket kept us from getting hurt. However,
I do not believe we will fall. You see your
horns are nicely rounded and curved and are not
sharp like the Moo-Cow’s, though really she did
not mean to poke holes in my balloons with them
as she did. So, perhaps, you would like to come
airshipping with me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>“I think I would,” the sheep gentleman replied,
scratching his ear with his left foot.</p>

<p>“Come along then,” invited the rabbit gentleman,
as he led the way to his airship.</p>

<p>“Oh, wait!” cried Nurse Jane. “I wish you
would bring home some sugar Wiggy, and also
take these scissors. They are dull and need
sharpening. Have the grinder man fix them.”</p>

<p>“I will,” promised Uncle Wiggily. Then he
and the sheep got into the clothes basket of the
airship, sat down on the soft sofa cushions filled
with the Wibblewobble duck feathers and away
they sailed above the tree tops.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is fine,” cried Mr. Baa-Baa, as he
looked down at the earth below. “I just love
this airshipping!”</p>

<p>“I thought you would,” Uncle Wiggily said.
“But there is the sugar store just below us and
also the scissor-grinder man. We will go down.”</p>

<p>Down they went, landing as gently as a
feather, for the toy circus balloons were all right
now. Uncle Wiggily bought the sugar, had
Nurse Jane’s scissors sharpened, and then he and
the sheep started off again, sailing above the tree-tops.</p>

<p>They had not gone very far before all of a
sudden it began to get dark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p>“My! Is it going to be night so soon?” asked
Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>“No, but I think there is going to be a thunder
storm,” said Mr. Baa-Baa. “See the clouds are
over the sun. That is what makes it dark. Yes,
we are going to have a storm!”</p>

<p>And, surely enough, in a little while, it began
to lighten and thunder, and then it began to rain.
Oh! So hard.</p>

<p>Then it got very cold, and it began to hail,
though it was summer time. Down came the big,
round, frozen hail stones, pattering on the Japanese
umbrella of the airship.</p>

<p>“Oh, how cold I am!” cried Uncle Wiggily.
“I am freezing! My paws are so cold and stiff
that I cannot steer the airship. You will have to
steer, Mr. Baa-Baa, for I cannot.”</p>

<p>“But I do not know how to steer an airship!”
cried Mr. Baa-Baa.</p>

<p>“Then we are lost!” shouted Uncle Wiggily.
“My paws are almost frozen from the hail stones.
I cannot hold the steering-wheel any more. Oh,
what shall we do?”</p>

<p>The airship was wabbling from side to side,
and almost turning over, for Uncle Wiggily’s
cold paws could no longer steer it properly.</p>

<p>“Quick!” cried the sheep. “I know what to
do! Take the sharp scissors and cut off some of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
my warm wool. Wrap it about your paws, like
mittens. That will warm them, and then you
can steer us safely to the ground. Shear off my
wool.”</p>

<p>“But won’t it hurt you?” asked poor, shivering
Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>“Not a bit!” cried Mr. Baa-Baa. “Here, I
will cut off some of my wool myself, as your
paws are too cold and stiff.” Then, with Nurse
Jane’s sharp scissors, the sheep cut off enough of
his woolly fleece to make Uncle Wiggily a pair
of mittens. With them on, the rabbit’s paws
were soon warm enough so that he could steer his
airship. And a little later they were safely down
on the ground out of the cold hail storm.</p>

<p>“My! It is a good thing I took you along in
my airship, Mr. Baa-Baa!” said Uncle Wiggily,
as he gave Nurse Jane the sugar, and the muskrat
lady said the same thing. So you see you
should always take a pair of scissors and a woolly
sheep along, when you go airshipping in a hail
storm.</p>

<p>“Well, what are you going to do now?” asked
Uncle Wiggily of the sheep gentleman, as Nurse
Jane went in the hollow stump bungalow with the
sugar.</p>

<p>“Why, I think I’ll go back to the farm where
I live,” the sheep answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be in a hurry!” called Nurse Jane
from the window. “I was just going to give you
and Uncle Wiggily a treat.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a treat?” asked the rabbit gentleman.</p>

<p>“Ice cream,” answered the muskrat lady.</p>

<p>“Ice cream!” exclaimed Uncle Wiggily.
“How are you going to make ice cream, if I may
ask, Nurse Jane? You have no ice.”</p>

<p>“No, but I can use the ice-cold hail stones,”
Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy replied. “Scoop up a lot
of them for me, Wiggy, that’s a dear, and I’ll
make the cream ready to freeze.”</p>

<p>So, with the sugar which Uncle Wiggily had
brought from the store, Nurse Jane made the
cream. Uncle Wiggily and the sheep gentleman
scooped up a washtub full of the icy hail stones
which had fallen during the thunder storm, and
soon the ice cream was frozen.</p>

<p>“Ah, this is certainly a lovely treat!” exclaimed
the sheep gentleman as he ate a second
plate full of the ice cream.</p>

<p>“It is, indeed,” agreed Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p>And then the sheep gentleman went back to
the farm, and Uncle Wiggily went to sleep while
Nurse Jane washed the dishes.</p>

<p>Uncle Wiggily slept for a long, long time,
and he had a funny dream that he went on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
funny trip in his airship. Oh, it was a very far,
long trip, away off to a beautiful land in the
country, where the fields were green, and all
spotted with daisies and buttercups, and where
a little brook sang a song as it bubbled over the
mossy stones.</p>

<p>And now, as this book is just as full of stories
as it will hold I will not put any more in it. But
I will make a new book, and it will be called
“Uncle Wiggily in the Country.” In that you
may read all the funny things that happened to
the rabbit gentleman when he rode in his airship
over the farm, and fell on a load of hay. And so,
until that book is ready, I will just say: “Good-bye!”</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
